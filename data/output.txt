Introduction

	On June 6, 1992 an arsonist set alight the Fantoft Stave Church near Bergen, Norway and subsequently drove the controversy and attention surrounding Norwegian Black Metal into a frenzy. In August of the same year the Norwegian Black Metal solo project Burzum recorded an EP, Aske (“ashes” in Norwegian), which was released in March 1993. The album cover prominently featured a photograph of the 12th century church as a charred specter of its former, humble self. And, as if to call out to those involved in the Black Metal scene “Now you, too, can be as evil as you are supposed to be,” the first 1000 copies of Aske sold were accompanied by a lighter (Virkenes). In doing research for my original topic of Norwegian Black Metal’s effect on religious attendance in Norway, I realized that the hilariously over-the-top gore, desire for destruction, and constant theatrics on display in the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse, featuring the fictional Death Metal band, Dethklok, had been at least partially inspired by true events.

In the cartoon, the band’s hyper-popularity has made them the 9th biggest economy in the world, enabling them to spare no expense in their search of deeper, darker, more “brutal” metal. As an example, Dethklok commandeered a nuclear powered submersible in order to record an album “inside the ocean. In the heaviest, deepest, most brutal part: The Mariana Trench!” (“Dethwater”). Because “fish don’t gots no good metal to listens to [sic]”, they capitalize on the billions of fish just waiting for good metal and produce an album, for fish, with titles like “Murmaider”- a track detailing methods and instruments used in the act of mermaid murder. 

In real life, Norwegian Black Metal band members also sought the authenticity gained by pushing the boundaries of what was “brutal” or “metal” by cutting themselves during performances, burying their stage clothes for days at a time to imbue a smell of death and decay, burning churches, and in rare cases, murder. One member of the early Norwegian Black Metal band Mayhem who went by the nickname, ‘Dead’, shot himself in the head with a shotgun while he was alone in a house he shared with other band members. His suicide note was comprised of song lyrics and an apology that read “sorry about all the blood”. His body was discovered by fellow mayhem member Øystein ‘Euronymous’ Aarseth, who took pictures of Dead’s body before he called authorities, and it appears the claims that he made necklaces out of pieces of Dead’s skull have been verified by members of other bands in the scene (Moynihan 2003:55). Aarseth opened a Black Metal record shop called Helvete (Norwegian for “hell”) which became one of the very few, and the most influential, central meeting spaces for those involved in the scene. Helvete featured painted black walls, medieval-looking décor, and a constant stream of young, motley dressed customers. Shortly afterwards, in August 1993, Varg Virkenes (the man behind Burzum) was arrested for the murder of Aarseth after tempers flared, possibly over record profits or in retaliation to death threats made by Aarseth to Virkenes (Moynihan 2003:120).

Thankfully, the extreme violence as well as the intense media presence that accompanied the genesis of Black Metal in Norway only lasted a few short years. While Black Metal is still alive and well in its true, “original” form (both in local pockets and transnationally) and the overall lyrical and contextual themes remain largely unchanged, it quickly became clear to the entire scene that the sort of violent behaviors that were pulled out of a musical context and into one of physical action defined those early years were no longer sustainable on any scale. One could argue that this trend towards less violent behaviors being prescribed and performed by the “authentic” members of the scene was an early indication that as time went on, whatever intense emotions that allowed the violent actions to occur had at least partially faded. 

This, in a wider context, forms the basis of this paper. Considering this through an anthropological lens, I must first note that music has ancient origins, music is functional, and music is a mechanism of social process. Music creates the same kind of platform for identity and cultural solidarity that language does, not least because language (words, utterances) is directly used in a complementary manner in the type of music under consideration in this paper, but also because it is nearly ubiquitous to contemporary music in general. Music types or genres come out of describing the unique characteristics and rules of particular pieces of music and their underlying social processes and grouping them together. It is not uncommon to notice that performers of closely related musical types, but with different priorities or themes results in different (though not necessarily mutually exclusive) audiences. As Keith Kahn-Harris (2007:2) notes, a fragmentation started in Metal in the 1980s and:

this fragmentation initially occurred in two directions. One was towards the mainstream and the “pop” and “glam” metal popularized by bands such as Poison. The other direction was towards what Weinstein calls the “fundamentalism” of what became known as “thrash” or “speed” metal.

	Fundamentalism implies a disgust at decadence (in this case the decadence of pop metal) and a desire to return to a perceived state of purity.



Like languages, a near infinite potential for variety exists in music that allows performers to convey different meanings, suit different situations, or connect with different people. Music and language both change over time as a result of many things, but important among them is the unique experience of the individual. 

In the case of music, and specifically songwriting, the individual creator becomes the subject of investigation in the attempt to discern the ways in which the individual has been influenced by a wider culture, influences that wider culture themselves, and is influenced again in turn. I believe it is not only possible, but important to examine music and the individual creator as a necessary constituent of socio-cultural themes and draw out inferences and interpretations that can be generalized to a larger population.

In this paper I aim to provide a brief history of and context for Black Metal, describe its musical characteristics and some previous scholarly work, and attach a formal definition to the word “scene”. Further, I predict that an analysis of the lyrics of Norwegian Black Metal band Dimmu Borgir with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015) software will bring to light a decrease in negative emotion words and an increase in positive emotion words over the bands lengthy career. The goal of the analysis is to examine, at least in part, if and how long-term, idolized members of a decidedly intense, angry, and often violent community navigate the rigid structures of Black Metal while undergoing the mellowing of aging.

 My argument is grounded in theories from psychology- the positivity effect and socioemotional selectivity theory, which states, in essence, as people age they pay more attention and ascribe more importance or meaning to positive experiences and emotions than to negative ones, and are overall more likely in ambiguous situations to choose things related to positive emotion than to negative. In stark contrast to the quick flash and violent fizzle of early Norwegian Black Metal, Dimmu Borgir have released nine albums over 22 years, which should provide ample opportunity to detect the influence of the positivity effect.

Musical History, Genealogy, and Characteristics

Dimmu Borgir is one of the most popular and influential Norwegian Black Metal bands of all time. The band officially formed in 1993, close to when much of the violence associated with what is called the 2nd wave of Black Metal had died down and the Black Metal scene had developed a solid musical and social foundation. Though quite early in the history of Black Metal, by this time some Black Metal bands had already begun to branch out and pursue their own visions of what was more extreme and more befitting Black Metal. 

Musically, Black Metal has its characteristics: typical four piece “rock” band makeup (vocals, guitar, bass, and drums), almost unintelligible throat-growls for vocals, multiple time signatures, heavy “blast beat” drumming, “tremolo” guitar picking, and low production value. Terms like this are parts of sound that, when combined in a certain way, according to certain rules, form a song. These are mostly nominalist terms that can be considered under the umbrella of phenomenology as they are, or relate to, bodily actions and perceptible physical feedback. The case can be made that phenomenology, while useful in lots of contexts, often leaves one with a sense of “you had to be there”, and Black Metal certainly fits this description. A reader of this paper, for example, will now know the names of those Black Metal characteristics, but besides some kind of onomatopoeic inferences (e.g., blast beat drumming), a very limited meaning will be imparted. In cases like this, comparative studies of other genres (close or distantly related) will bolster the information gleaned from phenomenological descriptions, as in the study of phonemes of different languages in linguistics. I am reminded of the criticism Ruth Benedict met after her contemporaries learned her ethnographic account of Japanese culture, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, had been published without Benedict ever travelling to Japan to perform her investigations. It appears more clearly to me than ever that first hand, personal, even intimate experience is absolutely paramount to anthropological inquiries of any kind.

Thematically, Black Metal took cues from what is referred to as the “New Wave of British Heavy Metal” as bands like Black Sabbath and Venom explored more mystical and esoteric content, especially themes with a religious tone. 

	“Genres are not and cannot be static,” Kahn-Harris (2007:12) writes. “In both lay and academic forms of popular music writing, genre has taken on a more holistic meaning, covering both the music that is produced and the style in which it is produced. Genre is both a set of musical events and the social processes and communities that constitute that event”. Some bands eventually branched out thematically into Viking or Pirate Metal, some played faster and with still lower production value in a manner reminiscent of Thrash Metal, while other bands like Dimmu Borgir added synthesizers, increased production value, and even incorporated full orchestras. These differences are musically noticeable, but arose as a result of the various social processes and shifting values of social groups vying for the spotlight of a burgeoning scene. 

Dimmu started to increase production value on their 1999 album Spiritual Black Dimensions and really committed to it in 2001 with their fifth album, Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia. The band has won several Norwegian Grammy Awards, established a global following, and continues to produce music and tour to this day. At 22 years, Dimmu Borgir has one of the longest lasting Black Metal careers of all time. Despite going through several lineup changes, there are two founding members who remain in the band, Shagrath (vocals) and Silenoz (guitar). 

The same two members are also the writing force of Dimmu, which is primarily the reason I deemed them appropriate for this study of the positivity effect. Because the same individuals have always been writing the lyrics, we have some consistent data over time to work with. In addition to this, the initial prod for the idea of this study came from a personal reading of Dimmu’s lyrics and an off the cuff observation of different looking (or sounding) language, which I interpreted as sort of a mellowing out; a more introspective feel than an antagonistic one; perhaps the album seemed more subdued or to take a broader context into consideration (while staying within Black Metal themes). There appeared to be a certain awareness of the multi-dimensionality inherent in human existence absent in earlier albums.

Not all metalheads are fans of Dimmu, however. There are plenty of fans who (as they display the dichotomous themes rife in Black Metal) simultaneously accuse them of forsaking the true roots of the music by adding synthesizers and orchestral arrangements, and of needing to “grow up” and get rid of their “corpse paint” stage makeup and medieval-inspired costumes. As is common in underground or burgeoning music scenes when an act makes it big, many have suggested that Dimmu’s deviance from Black Metal’s norms and progression toward richer, fuller (and slightly more socially acceptable) sound was motivated chiefly by monetary interest, making them guilty of “selling out”. It appears the chief concern over selling out is the exchange of social solidarity for social power or capital. Fans may be concerned with abandonment by those revered within the scene and could be under the impression that either a) the principles of the scene have a price and once it is met the music that is so important to them will change, or b) once a band has accumulated enough wealth they will simply stop making music.

Black Metal is merely one pit-stop on the huge branch of the evolutionary tree of music that stems from the Rock and Roll period around the 1950s. It incorporates the mystical and religious themes of 1970s Heavy Metal (e.g. Black Sabbath) as well as the fast, distorted guitar present in early 1980s Punk and Thrash Metal, and many other artifacts from other genres. 

It is, however, a unique product of Norway. There are many theories on the ways in which Norway provided the environment for Black Metal to thrive. Some authors suggest that, among other things, a growing romanticism of the Viking past, concern over immigrants, rejection of Christianity, and a limited set of modes of expression all played a role in the Black Metal formation process. In his master’s thesis on Black Metal and identity, Olson argues:

Black metal emerged in Norway because of its wealth, peace and stability.

Norway is perhaps the best example of the successful, stable, modern state; the embodiment of the mundanity, lack of meaning and purpose that black metalers feel is synonymous with contemporary culture. Norway offered black metalers a safe, comfortable, stable life; black metalers set fire to Norway’s offer and tried to destroy everything associated with that safety and stability. Black Metalers found contemporary Norway, perhaps the greatest triumph of the modernist project, wholly unsatisfying and unacceptable. Black metal suggests a dramatic reevaluation of the self, other people and the basic nature of reality. Black metal defines itself in direct opposition to the stable modernity of contemporary Northern Europe. (129)



Olson goes on to lay out a neat summary describing Black Metal and says, “In all its forms and manifestations, black metal seeks to create an alternative to modernity and sweep away everything associated with the urban, Enlightenment-inspired, mundane world in which black metalers live” (2008:125)

The “Scene” and Previous Research

Olson recognizes a conflict key to the Black Metal scene and writes:

The conflict between individuality and group identity is one that particularly challenges contemporary culture and black metal in particular. Rhetoric regarding the importance of individualism, self-creation, and subjective morality are primary to black metalers all over the world. Some of this rhetoric is borrowed from the Church of Satan, some from the ideas of Frederic Nietzsche, and much from a widely distributed social Darwinist discourse, but all of it attempts to address problems with group identity and the power of the individual that have been significant to much 20th century discourse. (2008:4)



Addressing the topic of right-wing racism and nationalism, Olson notes: 

To characterize black metal as a necessarily racist or fascistic culture is to drastically oversimplify the ambiguous, often contradictory nature of racist and nationalistic discourses within black metal. It cannot be ignored, however, that black metal is produced largely by Europeans. Black metal’s fan base and more recent incarnations outside of Europe are far less heterogeneous however.



He goes on to explain that:

Satanic black metalers’ rejection of racism and neo-Nazism has nothing to do with notions of a “universal humanity” or a rejection of hate. Arkhon Infaustus [a Black Metal band] dismiss racism because its hatred is too specific and exclusive. Satanic black metalers often perceive the war, death and anguish that result from racism and Nazism as happy accidents caused by a misguided and contemptible herd mentality.

Interestingly, Dyrendal (year) addresses the overrepresented Satanist population of Black Metal fans and argues, “Satanists seem to construct a sense of individual, satanic identity as much or more from media consumption than from collective activities. For some, it is strengthened through participation in interactive media, where discussion of appropriate cultural products and strategies for using them is a recurrent topic” (page).

The environmental security hypothesis (ESH):

is a context-dependent theory of social preferences in which our perceptions of environmental security influence our social preferences and what we find most desirable during different social and economic conditions. Specifically, safety and security concerns are more salient in threatening and uncertain times, which causes people to make decisions that are more pragmatic and utilitarian. Thus, more meaningful themes and mature characteristics should be preferred during these threatening conditions to help reduce threat and uncertainty. Conversely, when times are more certain and less threatening, preferences for more meaningful thematic content and mature characteristics are less necessary, so themes and items related to fun, celebration, and the expression of carefree attitudes should be preferred.



Like Pettijohn and Sacco, I can consider song lyrics as a way of dealing with uncertainty, and I can simplify or modify their study to the point where I am merely making the assumption that the people who participate in the Black Metal scene are constantly feeling subjected to threatening social and economic conditions, with the goal in mind to draw parallels between their work and mine and work with another set of tentative predictions..

Socioemotional Selectivity Theory and the Positivity Effect

One theoretical framework with which to examine some changes in the emotional content in Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics over their career is Carstensen’s socioemotional selectivity theory: 

In which reduced rates of interaction in late life are viewed as the result of lifelong selection processes by which people strategically and adaptively cultivate their social networks to maximize social and emotional gains and minimize social and emotional risks. In the socioemotional selectivity model, social patterns observed in old age reflect gradual changes that unfold over the life course. The theory is rooted in the functions of social contact and, . . . posits that although the basic functions of interaction remain consistent across the life span, place in the life cycle influences the salience and effectiveness of specific functions. (1992:331)



Carstensen’s team interviewed 50 subjects of a longitudinal child-guidance study that had spanned 34 years at the time and is continuing today and found that: 

In young adulthood, having interactions with a wide range of people is probably highly functional. Entry into adulthood is a time in life where much information can be obtained from casual social interaction. In addition, lifetime mates and close friends are being identified from the broad range of available partners. In this sample, the most dramatic decline in interaction frequency occurred in the acquaintance category from age 18 to 30 By 30, subjects were much more focused on a select group of social partners. All but 4 of the subjects were married, and most had children. At this age, interactions with close friends also declined, but, interestingly, emotional closeness to them did not suffer. Emotional bonds with close friends continued despite reductions in contact. (1992:336)



	Grounded in the socioemotional selectivity framework is the “positivity effect” which “concerns the relative difference between older and younger people in attention to and memory for positive as opposed to negative material” and:

According to SST, a core constellation of goals operates throughout adulthood, including basic goals associated with attachment and control as well as goals associated with instrumental needs and emotional gratification. The key postulate of SST is that the relative importance of goals within this constellation changes as a function of future time horizons. (Reed and Carstensen 2012:1)



	In a recent study, Mikels and Shuster had subjects provide a continuation to a story as the main character in the middle of an ambiguous situation and their analysis revealed “that older adults interpreted ambiguous scenarios with less negativity relative to the young, which is consistent with a general age-related shift toward positivity. Importantly, these findings indicate that older adults do not necessarily create more positive meaning, but rather less negative meaning” (2015:5). 

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015)

To analyze Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics, I chose to use the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC, Pennebaker et al. 2015), which “counts words in psychologically meaningful categories. Empirical results using LIWC demonstrate its ability to detect meaning in a wide variety of experimental settings, including to show attentional focus, emotionality, social relationships, thinking styles, and individual differences”. They go on to remark, “The words we use in daily life reflect what we are paying attention to, what we are thinking about, what we are trying to avoid, how we are feeling, and how we are organizing and analyzing our worlds. The 80 language categories in LIWC have been linked in hundreds of studies to interesting psychological processes” (Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010:24).

	I would argue that song lyrics, especially song lyrics from such a marginal group with very strict rules of citizenship, would reflect a greater intentionality and therefore will be just as good or better suited for the type of analysis LIWC provides, supported by Pettijohn and Sacco’s statement, “Lyrics are an important form of communication, serving a variety of purposes as documented in the psychology of language literature. Lyrics tell stories and communicate with audiences in a manner similar to how people have conversations with each other” (2009:298). A number of similar studies have examined song lyrics alongside LIWC’s analysis, from which I have derived some clues about basic psychological traits associated with language apparent in data from LIWC.

	Lightman et al. gathered lyrics of both songwriters who had committed suicide as well as a contextual living counterpart’s to which they had been matched, with a total corpus of 560 songs. It is a valuable study and important to the background of this paper, but it yielded a mix of positive and negative results that may or may not be transferrable to the interpretation of Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics. Notably, they write:

While most psychoanalytic literature suggests that suicidal individuals are preoccupied with thoughts of death and the interminability of the present, the suicide group used significantly more future-tense verbs and fewer death-themed words than the non-suicide group. 

The suicidal group’s lower usage of death-themed words might be partially explained by the therapeutic benefits of writing. Therapeutic writing is based on the idea that writing about negative emotions and events can be cathartic, and has been heavily implemented into counseling and research. (2007:1221)



	DeWall et al., a group of cultural psychologists, chose to examine song lyrics as cultural products and analyzed the 10 most popular songs from 1980-2007 with LIWC and tested:

Whether changes in U.S culture between 1980 and 2007 influence an understudied cultural product in ways that reflect these psychological transformations: word use in popular song lyrics. We predict that popular song lyrics will serve as cultural artifacts of shifts toward self-focus, social disconnection, anger, antisocial behavior, and misery commonly found in self-report research. (2011:200)



They (2011:202-203) ask questions about popular music that I would ask of Dimmu Borgir: Are lyrics becoming more self-focused over time (more first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns)? More socially disconnected (fewer words related to social interaction)? More angry and antisocial (more words in those categories and swear words)? Include less positive emotion (lower percentage of positive emotion words)? I use this study as a main reference for which data to look at and reasonable methods of interpretation as they displayed positive results. They close by writing, “The broader implication from these findings is that psychological processes and cultural products mutually reinforce each other to remain in agreement with generational changes in psychological traits, goals, and emotions” (2011:205).

	In another study, Pettijohn and Sacco looked at #1 Billboard songs from 1955-2003 and found using environmental security hypothesis, LIWC, and the general hard times measure that:

Popular song lyrics were predicted to have more meaningful themes and content when social and economic conditions were threatening. Trends for more meaningful, comforting, and romantic lyric ratings were observed in more threatening social and economic times. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software, songs with more words per sentence, a focus on the future, and greater mention of social processes and intergroup themes were popular during threatening social and economic conditions.





Case Study: Dimmu Borgir

Methodology

The corpus I gathered to analyze came from nine different Dimmu Borgir albums released over 21 years and amounted a total of 81 songs. I performed the LIWC analysis twice on the entire corpus, once on the albums as a whole and again after segmenting the albums into individual songs. I originally wanted to treat whole albums as individual datum in order to consider the album as one piece of content instead of viewing it as made up of smaller parts (songs), which worked well for getting a general sense of how the data changed over time. However, dividing the albums into their constituent parts allowed for a much larger sample size (total n=81; average per album n=9) and added a little robustness to this simple analysis. 

The lyrics and some additional information were retrieved from www.darklyrics.com, a metal lyrics archive. Due to the small community size, penchant for home or amateur recording, the habits of record labels, and other factors, there are songs that appear on more than one album. In addition to this, the chronology of album releases can appear to be different at certain times due to the re-release of an album. I wanted to analyze the albums as close to the form in which they originally appeared, so I enacted some discrimination criteria for songs. I chose original-release format of albums in order to isolate the closest thing to a linear timeline, so there is no special release or “geographical bonus content” included in the analysis. I chose to allow songs that appear on multiple albums because I believe despite whatever demands the label placed on Dimmu for album content, the bands have always had the final say in Black Metal, and therefore the duplicate songs are artifacts of intentionality, represent a conscious decision of how the band wanted to interact with the community, and will be treated as such. Some of the albums included cover versions of songs written by other musicians, but as the songs were authored by other people they are not included in the analysis. There were also a number of songs across the different albums that are instrumental, had no translation, or had not been transcribed, and these have not been included in the analysis either.

Though an official translation would have been a better choice, www.darklyrics.com provided user-submitted translations, as well as user-submitted corrections to those translations (and to all lyrics in general). There is some risk here of invalidating any results I may find due to the issues present in things like word choice, synonyms, and semantics that can be difficult to accurately translate. LIWC includes multiple language dictionaries with which to analyze content so it was possible to analyze the lyrics in the original Norwegian, but as Dimmu officially started using English as their primary language on only their third record, I wanted to keep things simple and use only one language in this paper. 

Some of the categories LIWC uses will need to take the bilingual history of Dimmu Borgir into more consideration. Words per sentence, for example, may increase over time as a result of a growing linguistic competence rather than a move to more meaningful content.

Coding may also be a factor in considering the reliability of this paper. In contrast to all other studies referenced, this is a hugely simplified analysis and no attempts to account for coding or rating reliability have been taken.

Keeping with the trend of a much more simple analysis, I chose to perform a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), without many of the more complex statistical precautions and safeguards other authors have used in similar studies like what (cite lots of things?). Lightman et al. note that “The words that address affective or emotional processes can be divided into two categories: positive emotion words, such as happy and pretty, and negative emotion words, such as enemy and worthless” (2007:1219, authors emphasis) on the LIWC categories of “posemo” and “negemo” (words that correspond to categories of

(*denotes the beginning of each song, used as a marker in LIWC)



For All Tid

*Our hate shall win

Our evil shall grow

To fix itself in young souls

The final war shall we win

And the blood of the good shall fall as rain

Their short souls shall be gathered together

We shall reign over chaos and everlasting night.

We shall forget our feminine absent mothers,

And end all

A kingdom shall raise itself

In the ash of burned homeland

There is only one master ruler

We pay tribute to you Satan the king of the strong

Your time is has come

*Long in length the storm's blast wind

Strikes tidewaters

Strikes ocean over a treasure

Has quickly all forest-ponds frozen

And the snow covers a mountaintop

Soldier strong he was

Who sat unafraid in old days

Wanders to death-island chasm after his pure honorable conflict

Faded blue-horizon's land

Deserted and black earth

And good for forefathers who have ruled

The Norwegian ocean's dusk's fjord

The trip through dusk is grey

For me is it a shell of forefathers' lives

Fade blue mountains on the horizon

Into a turned-grey night

Travel over fading blue-horizon's mountains

And here in darkness I am deserted

Quickly has snow oppressed every bough

Quickly has king winter conquered earth

Here where once the old fell in the field in battle

In order to lay the island to waste

And make it clean

Over fading blue-horizon's mountain

Travel in its dark dark-man's word

Over land where forefathers' battle has conquered

Where Viking-sword sat plainly in sight

*Forgotten times on Jotuns path

There over high cliffs and mountains

Has marked it with dust and ashes

From when Alders' herds wandered these grounds.

Here Gandviks Cave trolls stamped forth

In an evil and large goblin-herd

Where rangers found a big wisdom

About the lands forest-life and dark sides

Here on the path who creeps eternally forth

Between banks where they difficult still

Can be seen in the horizon

So great it must have been

To look out over all this

And to wander so alone and free

An autumn evening in cold and light mist

Like many before me have experienced

And many before me have appreciated

But memories are forgotten as time passes by

And little is here that once were

Here like elsewhere leaves have wizened

But fallen down on a collapsed earth

Where dreams and lives have passed away

But maybe between a rock

Or behind an old bush

Sits still...

And waiting

*Every tear is frozen

Our soul is linked

Our hate is bloody

All happiness is gone away

All laughter is gone away

All life shall end in death

In a cold and deserted landscape

Shall the black horde step from

Our lord shall rise

Up for all time, rise his kingdom again

Our struggle shall be rewarded

Our names shall be written

Our minds shall pull the bough

All morality shall be cast away

You want but you die of shame

Now is the time come

Yes break the word of the good

Let us for all time become rulers on this earth

*Endlessly you fought on the steppes

Unmercifully you ravaged in the mountains

You took you victories with storm

Crunched your enemies with your hand

Oh, Attila!

Make me your servant

Oh, Attila!

Take me into your army

You lived in the darkness

You wandered in grief

You plundered with steel on horse

A proud and stubborn king

Which conquered each fortress

To so hoist the banner to feast

Attila, king of the Huns

King of warriors, our father

You gathered your strength from the darkness

And on plundering I now with you go

*Long... there away in darkness

Through treetops there moonlight shines

Long... there away in all mist

Inside my soul the black anxiety tears

On the moss-grown stones they show themselves

When night-darkness has fallen

Echoes... from their horror-full moanings

Endless... you can hear

In the horizon far away

Is glimpsed the talking mist

Hordes of fire ride in a flock

By daybreak they gather by a hidden-away headland

The ice-cold snow

Has come

This time

In everlasting snowfall



Stormblast

*Glimmering moonlight drifting up above us

Paths covered with frost leads the way

Black souls now travel through the night

In through the valley of fog

All has blackened

All light has faded away

Pure we now enter the kingdom

Remembering that our tracks will be followed

Surrounded by sorrow's haze

The journey moves on

As a band of corpse-dressed ghouls

We wander the wolverine's home

The breeze takes us over Norwegian marshes

Past every misty hamlet

With the hate in our angry minds

We now leave for never to return

*Come young brother

Give us your pure youth

Lay your life in our hands

Fight our war with us

Let our sorrows darken your mind

Let our soul be torn apart

Feel the night wrap itself around you

Forget all love

No tears shall fill your nights

Enter the ring of Brotherhood

No weakness shall be found in your soul

Strength shall wander by your side

Come

Share your hate with us

Leave your weak body

Do not be bewildered by enchanting words

In death lies all power

*Follow

Follow us

Through the hall of evil we travel!

Where the inverted cross leads the journey!

From the Omnipotence of darkness!

On the flesh of Christ we spit

Let it rot!

A symbol of disappearance of goodness

A play that is ended

Bring forth our inner anger!

Show the way for our hatred!

Give eternal suffering to God's souls!

In the paradise of evil they are yours!

*My soul did glow

And my mind did yearn

To get hold of a Christian fuck

In the cold darkness I waited with the wind

It howled as if possessed by the devil

I waited

Ah, I waited!

Time seemed eternal

But finally I got sight of a poor one

I raised my clenched fist

And screamed

Weak Christian!

Die tonight!

I shall tear your soul apart!

You will feel the poor I was granted from darkness!

Your time has come!

So has your faith's time...

...so has your faith

Pray for mercy you pitiful fuck

And my laughter shall once again resound

Loud in the cold of the night

Where frost will freeze your last...

Tear...

Weak Christian!

You died tonight!

With a might blow I cracked your skull

A bloody slaughter

From which voices will forever resound in the Kingdom of darkness

*Through timeless, decayed dreams

In a moist autumn wind over deserted plains

Against Sorias mountains

I come, a Devil's Knight

Smooth is the rune on the high mountain

Washed away by rain and winds

Enchanting force of evil lurks

Here at Trollhome's moldy gate

Perplexed by the dark building

Made of stolen gold from the pact of light

Used as mockery to make their walls fall

We ponder over this kingdom

So beautiful, filled with timeless dusk

As a star in the gorge of emptiness

Brings forth a nightly wondering

Over thoughts from a long gone time

Straight to the sky it is erected

From the endless black memories of time

Storm blown out of the black inner

Has rock rolled from heath to bottom

Wondering and anxiety gather in the night

In the darkness looming about the spire

For no day knows the way here

No light can sneak in

Where sorrow has conquered all joy

And built a land on human's earth

Filled with ice-cold splendor and glory

*Step on to my throne pale corpse

Fall to your knees in respect before my feet

Accept my cold kiss on your forehead

I've laid the path leading to hell

Lift your swords for battle,

Proud men

Let the massacre begin today

Decapitate every Christian

And rape their women and children

Every Christian cross you find, you shall turn

Every building under God's name shall burn

Every Christian man's grave shall be desecrated

Every night you shall awaken human beast

And feel the blood burning like fire inside you

Every night you shall rave like a mad in the streets

And annihilate every sign of life

Hear my speech human beast

My words are your future

I am the embodiment of Satan

I am your master

I am evil

I am Antichrist

*In the darkest of darkness I intone

In my halls silence steps forth

Fallen angels are guarding my gates

In the beauty of valley of death

My soul has gone astray

While darkness and sorrow ruled

The fire of hate was lit

In the black silence of the night

My silent self steps forth

In the darkness a corpse burns

Another black soul has returned

In silence we observe the journey

The journey of our sorrow-black brother

And no tears fall

When ashes are united with dust

We shall all share his fate

We shall all follow our friend

When the bells of judgement day chimes

We shall all return

To rule

*A proud knight returns home

From heaven to heaven on a self-made bridge

From the endless battle against the pries of light

And now he shall rest

See into the inner of the mountain breeze

Where its life has sought shelter for a sun

Which in end will go dark with the eternal night

And prevent our world from blooming and growing

See the satire of the eye

Where remains of good is chased away

And is blown away in an open grave

Until the last light has been put out

With powerful blows to human's heads

The knight rejoice in a dark mist

High as the sky, wandering over his own star

Glaring at a world covered with ice

Over innumerable fallen man

Who sowed the growing seed of life

He wanders away from the last war

The might prince, the bloody thorn

*Devoted are we

To the emperor of the dark

The power of the almighty

leads our minds

Into battle

Against the good and their lies

Though the enemy's army is poor

It is big

But we shall take them all

Gather them up

One by one

The hope they saw in God

Shall I disappear in an ocean of thorns

The thorns their fake messiah

Once felt nailed to his skull

Heaven shall be torn

And a fucking thunder

Shall boulder and roar

His powers will go weak

Where the front of dark

Conquer the plague of light

Eyes will run in sorrow

When they realize (that) their god

No longer can help

The hope they found in God

Is gone and so it shall be forever

Now they follow their fake savior

Who still carries a crown of thorns

But king he never became



Enthrone Darkness Triumphant

*Daylight has finally reached its end

As evenfall strikes into the sky

Far away in the dark glimpsing moonlight

Sickening souls cry out in pain

Whispering voices summoning screams

Waiting for Satan to bless their sins

Black hearted angels fallen from grace

Possessed by the search for utter darkness

Hear the cries from the Mourning Palace

Feel the gloom of restless spirits

Hear the screams from the Mourning Palace

Feel the doom of haunting chants

Eternal is their lives in misery

Eternal is their lives in grief

Abandoned in a void of nothingness

A chain of anger, a fetter of despair

In this garden of depraved beings

This unsacred place of helpless ones

Satan blessed the creatures

Enswathed them in endless night

Whispering voices, summoning screams

Waiting for Satan to bless their sins

Black hearted angels fallen from grace

Possessed by the search for utter darkness

*You have returned to the torture-chambers

To find peace among the rotting corpses

You have returned to the execution place

To inhale the smell of blood

Death and terror rules the land

We have been spellbound

You have returned to the hidden graves

Only you know about

You have returned to face your victims

And feel sensation of violence once again

Death and terror rules the soul

You have been spellbound

By the Devil

Murderer, you have returned

To create fear and sorrow

Death and terror rules the land

We have been spellbound

By the Devil

*By the light of the moon

And the beings of the night

A curse has been laid upon us

To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces

By the power of death

And the shadow of the reaper

A call has been brought upon us

To complete the infinite fall of heaven

Without the wit or will to end this journey

We continue travelling towards our faith

Harvesting helpless Christian spirits

Raping the sanctity of saints

The heavenly father is stretching his hand

Pathetically begging for mercy

We spit and piss on his sacred flesh

As we breathe the breath of the unholy

For with the sign of the pentagram

Hellfire rage is for us to come

As we shall wander the pit

Unhallowed by the infernal one

We are forever captured

By the embrace of death

*King of tempests and storms

Lord of innumerable figures and forms

Blessed with thy cold I am

As I upon the shoulders of mine

Bear the burden of Thine

Once I got touched by a fire from beyond

An invitation to darkness of which I could not resist

Caressed by the feathers of the fallen

I took the fate in my hand

My raging Commander

My constant Shade

My soul's Persecutor

My eternal Divinity

Revealing Thy powers in visions and dreams

Invoking your magic at night

Honored I am to mission Thy word

Within a creed is sworn of majestic might

An infernal allegiance in which I pay my share

An unholy awakening inside of which I intend to bear

Beholding Thy commotion

I entreat You with devotion

I subsume Your might with strength

I will carry on with You as my guardian

Against the lambs of the light

Possesses by the true god of earth I am

Possessed for eternity

*A scarlet sunset

The threshold to night play

A sinful oath is to be sworn

A beckoning bloodlust

Among the seekers

Tyrannical hunger yearns

A gathering in flames and fires

Devil's daughter’s dance

Scourged in filth obscene and lewd

Longing to dark desires

The nocturnal beast appears

In an evil despotic shape

Expectant watching gracelessly

Before demanding the sluts of lust

"Come forth harlots, let's begin!"

"Rise and give praise in front of Me

And receive eternal life from Me!

Welcome my spirit in honor of Me!

So drink of the blood I provide you

And you shall all forever wander in

The shadows of death...!

"Oh yes, Master! Let us receive

Thine offer and drink with thee!

And become a part of Thy realm

With lust, sex and sodomy

For we are those who seek life eternally...!

"Blood is life and it shall be all ours!"

*I could drag you to my chambers

And strip you naked in darkness

I could pull your fingernails out one by one

And rape you till you find no hope

I could rip your guts out

And let you watch me

Sacrifice your unborn child

I could leave you to starve

And even bring you to total silence

...but I won't

For I find no pleasure in your physical pain

I want your Christian soul to crumble

Your fucking soul

When I have seen your church go up in flames

And you are weeping I will laugh

When I have seen you mourn over loved ones

I will feel bliss when your mortal soul is in ruins

I will grin in the shadows

For that gives me pleasure...

...tormenting a Christian soul

*Soul on departure six six six

Onward onto another existence

A trip far beyond all pleasant dreams

A voyage through desolation sights

Inner transformation

Subconscious flight

In the glance fields of fires

In the distance meadows of might

Where minds being enshrouded in a complete night

The fading of love, life and light

Wandering an endless journey

Dead within a trace

Entering a lost dominion soulless and free

Visiting a foreign place but yet so known

Another dimension opens for me to see

Heaven sure ain't made for me to be

Soul on arrival six six six

One short step from unhallowed ground

The ground of a Kingdom Come

Dead spirits communion

Unorthodox profane void

Gardens, temples, palaces

I have seen them all

In search for insanity, sanity slowly drowns - In trance

*Master of disharmony

Welcome my tainted soul

Take me from the hordes of the living

Into the blessed darkness

Master of disorder

Take my impure flesh

Lead me unto the path of temptation

Save me from cowardice

Master of sin

Take my cursed heart

Bring me where I can find salvation

For I am the damned

Master of death

Take my pitiful life

I am enslaved

I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin

Take my cursed heart

Bring me where I can find salvation

For I am the damned

Master of death

Take my pitiful life

I am enslaved

I shall never forget the pain

*He became the swarm, indeed a pitiful imitation

To the verge of a quiet glance, an oracle without eyes

Darkness... My precious companion, even thou can’t see his face

Salvation turned to bleed despair, compassion fled...

Sadistic delight flowed, like Hell burned brighter

Existence woven into darkness, prudence did fall

...In Satan's beauty, life was found...

A flow of orgasmic fire, swept through the cosmic night

I enthroned darkness triumphant, with the searing trident of the Inferno

Gaze towards the Heavens, you might catch a glimpse of Me...

*Illness and plagues, torture and blight

Is what she brings

Mocking holy standards, deceiving feeble fools

Is what she loves

Granted with powers, gifted with magic

Watching the world through raven eyes

Damned woman mischievous whore

Heretic princess

Devil's own

Her seductive elegance

Excites your weak flesh

Her diabolical beauty

Enchants your bewildered mind

You damn woman

You mischievous whore

You heretic princess

You are Devil's own

A serenade made out of black magic

She has learned to set souls afire

And makes sure that you never

Will leave its trance

Her diabolical beauty

Enchants your bewildered mind

*Long... there away in darkness

Through treetops there moonlight shines

Long... there away in all mist

Inside my soul the black anxiety tears

On the moss-grown stones they show themselves

When night-darkness has fallen

Echoes... from their horror-full moanings

Endless... you can hear

In the horizon far away

Is glimpsed the talking mist

Hordes of fire ride in a flock

By daybreak they gather by a hidden-away headland

The ice-cold snow

Has come

This time

In everlasting snowfall



Godless Savage Garden

*The witch born queen, leader of demonic whores

Profane mistress, captor of sin

Sworn to feed the ill and the weak

and bring their women and men into temptation

Eliza, the whore of the night

attends the sabbath, the theatre of lust

The hunter is in the ring, caressing folds of flesh

- Diabolical intercourse profound

She who brings horror to the insane

and haunts the sick and its kind

Selector of innocent holy infants

tempting their flesh, poisoning their mind

The young harlot, who acts by the trust of her fate

Cursed beneath the hands of doom, the grand master of hate

For her and hers the bells chime

Damnation's own

Evil superior siren, moonchild domain

- A sculpture for the holy to burn

*The quest for Azunda hath drawn near

The young king, the chaos he brings

With iron grip's sword, chants come forth

The child of dark he is

In prophecy, chaos not near

In chaos, prophecies began

This child of dark, hath foreseen

He makes his own destiny

The magic he creates is from his will

The magic of Azunda, he shall receive

Iron grip's sword guides his path

To the place which is no more

The journey to this place is creation

In this creation, he shall be

Living for himself and his destiny

In his path, lies of the prophecies

In his mind he sees another

Who wishes to receive, Azunda

He sees light within in his enemy

And laughs at the prophecy

His will and his word is his sorcery

He is waiting for thee

To put an end to this prophecy

Azunda, give your power to me

The child of dark has found thee

And now must destroy, evil thee

Iron Grip's sword has gone through thee

Now, Azunda is mine for all to see

The king's task has been complete

The chaos has begun for all to see

*Long... there away in darkness

Through treetops there moonlight shines

Long... there away in all mist

Inside my soul the black anxiety tears

On the moss-grown stones they show themselves

When night-darkness has fallen

Endless... you can hear

In everlasting snowfall

*Through timeless, decayed dreams

In a moist autumn wind over deserted plains

Against Sorias mountains

I come, a Devil's Knight

Smooth is the rune on the high mountain

Washed away by rain and winds

Enchanting force of evil lurks

Here at Trollhome's moldy gate

Perplexed by the dark building

Made of stolen gold from the pact of light

Used as mockery to make their walls fall

We ponder over this kingdom

So beautiful, filled with timeless dusk

As a star in the gorge of emptiness

Brings forth a nightly wondering

Over thoughts from a long gone time

Straight to the sky it is erected

From the endless black memories of time

Storm blown out of the black inner

Has rock rolled from heath to bottom

Wondering and anxiety gather in the night

In the darkness looming about the spire

For no day knows the way here

No light can sneak in

Where sorrow has conquered all joy

And built a land on human's earth

Filled with ice-cold splendor and glory

*Master of disharmony

welcome my tainted soul

Take me from the hordes of the living

into the blessed darkness

Master of disorder

take my impure flesh

Lead me unto the path of temptation

save me from the cowardice

Save me from the cowardice

Master of sin

take my cursed heart

Bring me where I can find salvation

for I am the damned

Master of death

take my pitiful life

I am enslaved

I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin

take my cursed heart

Bring me where I can find salvation

for I am the damned

Master of death

take my pitiful life

I am enslaved

I shall never forget the pain

*By the light of the moon

And the beings of the night

A curse has been laid upon us

To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces

By the power of death

And the shadow of the reaper

A call has been brought upon us

To complete the infinite fall of heaven

Without the wit or will to end this journey

We continue travelling towards our faith

Harvesting helpless Christian spirits

Raping the sanctity of saints

The heavenly father is stretching his hand

Pathetically begging for mercy

We spit and piss on his sacred flesh

As we breathe the breath of the unholy

For with the sign of the pentagram

Hellfire rage is for us to come

As we shall wander the pit

Unhallowed by the infernal one

We are forever captured

By the embrace of death



Spiritual Dark Dimensions

*Glowing eyes, staring eyes

Manifest of evil presence

With entities swept in disease and decay

A fall from paradise beyond redemption

Wrath child’s afterglow

He who speaks of nightly treasures

He who wraps the serpent around my neck

He who pours poisonous wine in my chalice

He who lets me serve and slip away

...and so i will take shelter

In the absence of the light

Hiding like a masked miniature in the dark

A revenant without relief it seems

For the art of becoming a progeny

and to be raised in such curse

Is to forever creep among naive mortals

Infesting the dead in hordes

His grandeur of guidance in roundtrips obscure

He who immerse my hands in sullen thrills

His paths on which domination linger

He who dares to prove the sanity of mine

He who speaks of nightly treasures

He who lets me serve and slip away

Black unearthly void creatures crawling

Forbidden forgotten fairly underrated

Bastards in the shape of angels holding my hands

Passing me what is left of the wine

*A mental inner vortex

as possessions through a wolf's eye

Envisioning the eclipse

No longer to be blinded by a sunrise

In this final benediction

Confronted by mirages of imminent mortality

Time's set to end the suffering

So follow, I will cherish the secrecies of hearts

Chased by the black shepherds

Behind the curtains of night

Been found as a tool in their seduction

Fatal haze

An escape into abomination

Perished to phasma

A syndrome of another aeon

Soul-obsequial inhesion

Resurged in torrents of abysmal thoughts

Lost in a helix, blackest might

In stealth i do seek deliverance

In phantasmagoria, vortex utopia

*When the ghastly mourners awakens from sleep

And the violent funeral crows are watching

Like evil omens in shadowed murmur

They welcome me again

Agonized and flattered to once become

A part of this horror scenario

I descend with arms open wide

Armored and filled with painful pleasure

Reflecting streams of monstrous mirages

I will not hide

Losing control in seductive madness

Spiritual revelations, apocalyptic hypnosis

Dead colors appear within unhallowed graves

Alone in awe I face abhorrence below

Trapped inside to suffer in silence

Torn apart in mind and sense

Baptized in this nightly glamour-

Rites of splendid essence

Agonized and flattered I once became

A part of the horror scenario

Armored and filled with painful pleasure

I did not hide

Now when the gates are no longer shut

I withdraw from the light of the sun

*Unfolding her carnal desires to me

With tempting eyes she does receive

A hunter of the night devil's whore

May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

We embrace the madness gathered as one

Mourning dead passion...she comes to me

A fate awaits us in the night

In the ruins of creation we will unite

Unfolding her carnal desires to me

With tempting eyes she does receive

A hunter of the night devil's whore

May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

She comes to me - a shining beacon

Confused by the sensual innovation

Passion ... towards the image of mortal evil

Passion ... embraced by the image of united death

The enigma lies broken

Searching for those precious moments

Reaching for a higher state of existence

Like a newborn migrant in the void

I am smitten by the forbidden fruit

Possessed by moments of dark splendor

To walk the nightmare terrains forever

The enigma lies broken

Possessed by moments of dark splendor

To walk the nightmare terrains forever

United with new unhallowed grace

This cursed beauty haunts me forever

*Erotic and dreamlike still in its mortal disguise

A passionate ritual in the ruined gardens theatre

The painted angels - Shadowed high above

Once they gathered to worship at the picture of me

Like a whisper where there are no words

Appears the perplexed - The statue of might

In the cradle of the next generation

A spiraling ruin - Lost in the gathering dust

...the faces you saw in the withering garden

I witnessed the flickering - made to look like stone

Quivering like little figures lost in broken flames

Never to forget again the names carved in horrid flesh

Those words drawn in water - Become our legacy of fantasies

Burn the pictures

So unexpected in this strange deserted place

Once opened its secrets would become the world

Its attributes would continue to unfold forever

"Through the fabric of the promised future eons

I offer this suffering of my unwanted father..."

...and the stars did wander - Separated in the forbidden universe

*With hearts of midnight, brightened by His infernal light

We stand as a monolith of wrath, united under the goat of a thousand young

Two horns thrust upwards in defiance, three inverted as the trinity denied

A phalanx of mourners in black, falling towards nightly terror

Unleash the tempted beast, raised your horns in prideful blasphemy

I'll be your guide into the glorious darkness, and enchant you like a taste of sin

Unleash the tempted beast, chant thereon in words of blazing scorn

Grant me my dark desires, strengthened through the power of Satan

Take pleasure in the torment of the wretched

and rejoice in the delight of the flesh

Behold the face of Satan

and walk the fields of erotic fire

Hunt the heavens...

Godless temples beckon

Through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare

Gathered between symbols and signs

A glow of new light is born out of the night

Give into your lust and carnal desires - In twisted blood-dripping ecstasy

In the name of Satan - I lead you into temptation

*Passenger on confessional course

Unlock with the key you behold within

Repair the shadow of your mind and come awake

Oh, dreadful angel of mine

Enrich me with the vastness of being

Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend

I'll commit myself to understand

To be faithful and the instrument

So that the ones with blindfold can see what I have seen

That there is nothing in between

For I am the accomplice...

Aghast and tender, indulged in sin

Embraced by loneliness, legions who grin

I blunder into the realms of slumber

I collide with the obscure

And see the last fraction of light go by

Plundering the sanity from the insane

And providing appearances in black

Carefully swept in decadent spheres

But faces in this world always remain darkened

In circles of dominance, emotional deeps unite

Fiction and transcendence woven together

In the essence of purity lies wisdom

Join the forces, the spiritual black dimensions

What more do you need of proof

Human hands conforming cloven hoofs

For I know the secrets and lies behind all truths

Knowledge is power and the power is mine

It's all mine

So let the children come to me

And share the limitless ways to infinity

Escape death and disease

And behold youth and vitality

Oh, dreadful angel of mine

Enrich me with the vastness of your being

Rigid father, teach me how to comprehend

I'll commit myself to understand

For I am the accomplice...

*"In the shadows of my gallows

I'd rather absent the hallow..."

(For) Thy presence made pleasure of pain

(and) Thy madness turned sanity into vain

Profoundly wicked owner of souls

The mysteries of Thy creation beheld by ghouls

Diabolically disguised heavenly bodies

(and its) atrociously desired primordial elements

Plunging through the confused heart of Sulphur

In all this darkness, how can man see

"Pour misguided fool ...

It is not God you are talking to

I am not imposturous, hiding behind pearly walls

However, I am still yet to be found, known

I shall guide you on your midnight-ride as the sun fades black

(and) beyond your grotesque imagination

my name will be revealed...

The blood of Christ can't heal your wounds

Give me all of yours, and I'll give you mine..."

I am the hidden fantasy

In the secret of my knowledge

There is no God but me

In this shadowy world all are nameless

Outstanding, dressed in majestic splendor

Touched by the flames of eternal fire

How I long for your embrace, uttermost desire

*In perplexed dementia, where sanity is my vanity

With honor bear the mark of Satan

Triumphant beast in heaven defeat

Disguised in gloom, wear the mask of Satan

Ride the beast through paradise

Still vipers these mortal burdens

We arise as the portals take form

I leave my feathers again

Infidels and scarecrows all fallen from heaven

Captured by the sin of the beast

Mesmerized in total chaos

Engulfed in an overflow of selfish might

Swept through arcane mysteries

Forlorn in a maze of torment

Raped by the sanctity of the unholy

Reveals a Hell I never dreamed of

Bewildered by the arcane life-force mysteries-

I shed my skin once again

*In massing darkness we stand united

Raging above inferior sheep

A convoy of souls swept into the night

Hearts strengthened with black fire passion

In us is fulfilled the prophecy of satan

Evolution of the inner shrine

In us is maintained the revelation of satan

Innocence brought to an end

In honor of thy unearthly creation

We bring forth thy divine form

Vanity throughout any conceptions

Blazed and bound for the days are coming

Infernal madness, unholy ascendance

Christian death abound in mourning perversion

Cherished sacred icons torn to pieces

They'll chase the serpent in everlasting nightmare

Disharmonic illusions of strings bending loose

Wrapped, penetrating skin

Listen to the music of their agony

Eyes made of glass, mirrors within



Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropria

*Infected by invalid behavior

While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction

Confess to slavery for the world savior

Give praise and inhale the corruption

The Enfeebled provides the fool

The Disabled provides the tool

The Apathetic demands the affection

To those suffering from their own satisfaction

Devour in self-deceit, conjure the righteous plague

Testify today’s contradiction, glorify tomorrow’s deed

Inconceivable moral priest, hide in preferable dress

Invite to another pleasure feast, the concealment of joyful laughter

The decrepit innocence of your correctness and well-chosen

Elicits the source of the need for immediate forgiveness

Submit to no grace but the spiteful of your disease

Apply to join the unlimited disgrace and a settlement in the skies

And turn the confusion among your children into self-stimulation

The incarnation of your prostitution, the true Evil in disguise

With the ignorance from your cross as the witness

The truth of your tragedy make you justice

In your mirror the high spirit of kindness

Looks like malice

Condemnation of life by the living dead

What a premature judgement, contradiction to the core

How unfortunate I am, cursed to spend time on a battle already won

The shame that will be guarding your grave says it all

Retreat to the crypt and make it worthwhile

Recall my sins furthermore but still be watching yours with a smile

*Incarnated marvels simplified

Effects from such a disconsolate kind

Impotence of the once so perfect living

Erase and rewind

Stand rigid for the next battle

Peace means reloading your guns

The love for life is all hatred in disguise

A carnival creation with masks undone

In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin

Through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind

Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth

Confidently dawned, to pick the best of enemies

An abyss womb stretched wide open, exposed to retaliate

With the stigma feasting upon your flesh I wish you well

Thorns from the fountains of fate licking leprous skin

Worshipped by anyone's mass on our planet hell

What on earth possessed you

Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues

Devoured by doubt, conducting arts of misconception

Testimonial sufficiency declaring numbness of all perceptions

Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface

And enjoy the suffering, sanity drained in disrespect

With such bedeviled faith in good, subsequently trusting evil

Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin

Left are the kings of the carnival creation

Carrying out the echoes of the fallen

Sense the withering eternity as it fades away

The ultimate graceless voyage of all times

Only death will be guarding your angels, silently

Cripples joining arms in clamor

Institutionalized for the rebirth, the herd will be hunted

*The apparition of two faces in disgust

Invisible but yet so clear

Reflections seen by a fugitive

Trying to escape the looking glass

Blood runs from open wounds of false flesh

The one in front of the mirror exceeds the image

Eager to leave further but chained still

To crumble into such nothingness

A despairing fate, for your lies

To pretend is the lunatic's legacy

Privileged to bolt the nails of heresy

Born lifeless into a world of coma

As the chronic sufferer trapped in paradise lost

Missing insinuations of what life was meant to be

Angels and demons, a march man's bewildering hosts

The charlatans and deceivers walk the line in prejudice

The narrow slits the veins in search for the crown

Profound impatience makes the blind struggle in stupidity

The paradox of the daily prayer, diffidence is Confiteor

Phenomena of ironies, cast the litany aside

How intelligible, blessed be the forgetful

Holding the banner high, unrestrained

Slowly abandoning the surface in contempt

Still in costumes to please the ways of living

Witnessing the details of defilement, intoxicating

Make sure to be pleased with the ways of your death

For in days of reckoning and when the twilight torn is ticking

Elysium is halfway and as an answer to the plea

You're destined to yield fragments of Hell in return

Leave unnoticed with the perfect conscience

With the strength of the spiritual eye

Spirits of the token unchained and free

Recover from the philanthropic macabre frenzy

The pale dove grins, black at heart ready to flee

Demon to some, angel to others

*A dismal universal hiss, the sound of public scorn

The brush that sweeps across the spectral fields

This landscape is not without a sense of epic wonder

A vast scale that places this sprawling underworld

Into a realm of frames

With a blood-storm fading into the distance

Floating without directions over this shouldering landscape

Caught in a moment of transformation

These shades of anatomic malignant nature

Approached on another in an unpleasant way

Frozen in the act of speech, desperate to express its state

Created in a shape to accommodate a wide variety of demonic forms

The realm of the benighted aristocracy of evil most pure

This is where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep

Emerged from the depths of the earth gasps

It rages against mankind, to annihilate the earth and worse

It spills the blood like rain, the beauty of death it represents

Devouring their flesh with a razorblade smile

Genes would still blindly carry on shouldering ember of hell

Limned with gold leaf, the scarlet brush

That sweep all traces of time, place and pattern

Total death in every nation

Monuments of vanquished civilization

Just as brilliantly removed ruthlessly eliminated

The cornerstone of human emotions

Has now been drained away

I saw death of a most uncommon nature

*We do away with your kind

Countdown to exterminate the human race

4, 3, 2, 1

Let chaos entwine

On defenseless soil

Remove errors of man

And sweep all the weakening kind

I am war, I am pain

I am all you've ever slain

I am tears in your eyes

I am grief, I am lies

Bygone are tolerance

And presence of grace

Scavengers are set out

To cleanse the human filth parade

I am pure, I am true

I am all over you

I am laugh, I am smile

I am the earth defiled

I am the cosmic storms

I am the tiny worms

I am fear in the night

I am bringer of the light

Earth successfully erased.

*Oh, look at those lifeless leaves

All their precious pride is taken away

A lost creation for a graven image

Trembling of nothing but their own fear

On behalf of water made to wine

Elements of deception must entwine

Righteous greed and derangement divine

Vacuum is given to the blind

To surrender to a faith so fake

To not comprehend while you're awake

Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake

Do lose your battle before actual birth

For some sheep need the company of a shepherd

To face the scorn of the earth

Existential parasite drama across the lands

What a relief never bother the whys

Investing illusions and folding hands

The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies

All those naked faces, empty shells

Procreation of the mind put to rest

Crippled and caged, anesthesia adjust

The lambs of slaughter preoccupied in disgust

*Ride the vortex winds with the beast inside

Cast down all memories from a past and future world

The cynic icons and the cryptic writings

As a picturesque creation in force and spirit

Against their reason and will, it is time

Give darkness its passion plea

The venomous tongue

The inevitable poison

Paralyze the angels

Freeze the forgiven

Baptize in fire

Unleash the devil at heart

Unleash the maelstrom mephisto

So sinner, mourn well

Make all the swans suffer in hell

The maelstrom of the mephisto left the trace

To revel and feast in undelivered grace

Pledged to judgmental arrogance in

Drawn principles of ignorant falsehood

To comprehend that the sin of life is life itself

A tyranny in torment, an inner-sanctum stealing sleep

In the dimness surrounding the towers of the castle

Where the ravens spread their wings out wide

Dwell in depths of the darker self at any shore of infinity

And watch the relentless paint the soil black

What is being formed echoes throughout eternity

As the painter chooses color no more

Hold your shadows close when the comedy is over

As the days of mourning seem to be the days of joy

Fragments fell from the sky in order to penetrate the eyes

A convict wallowing in a lifetime of lies

*As cyclones detach from the world above

And all the other worlds beneath them flow

Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories

Sought, to strive in twilight mist and penal fire

As daylight suffers, night time recollects

For what wind hath drawn near, so near:

Death has a contract on life and hell in-between

What was once not certain is now foreseen

When the pendulum is in its reverse factor

Rivers run red and skies turn black

Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within

Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss

A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education

Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence

Where pearls are chained for each tragic event

The glorification of deviance in progress

Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more

Drowning victims of a parallel universe

The scum of the earth, a rejoice of fouls

The world hates you for being precise

*Chains of despair

Cloaked by darkness

The thundering echoes of great destruction to come

Mankind's mysteries

The dying world

Madness in its sweetest form

What shrivels and dies must face the tempest

The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth

And melancholy grew

Anticipation mender through madness

Condemned to the same horrid fate

Insanity applauds

How sharp the awakening

Pale as disease

Mocking: Maddening:

Give up the ghost

Cease the gloomy awakening

History foretold

The hidden stigmata

Totally annihilating the ecstasies innumerable

Materialize the vision

Give up the ghost

Cease the gloomy awakening

*Thousand different paths

So many sterile ends

I chose the Devil's path

Never shall the sun kiss my face

And caress me with its burning light

For I dwell in the shadows

And sleep side by side with death

In dark desire I embrace the whore

Giving her an escape from an unworthy life

For with the appearance of the Fallen Angel

I serve Satan

I serve Darkness

I am a prince among the damned

As I've been for eternity

A monarch in a dark paradise

Cursed by life and the living

Oh tremble not my immortal heart

Though you beat in the shadows of death

Eternal life is the blessing

And I shall rule for another thousand years

I blew out the light

Abandoned Jesus Christ

Christian life forms' griefs

We buried their beliefs

Waiting for their saviors rebirth

The dawn was soon to come

The dawn would soon be gone

There in that formless abyss was I made

A partaker of the mysteries averse



Death Cult Armageddon

*Cuddled through a cold womb he was

Pitch black and without sunshine rays

Hell patiently awaiting him on blood spilled soil

A noble grief stirred heart, always ready to die

In sinister systematization, submission is golden

As an apprentice to violence, slaughter and bloodshed

He was like an object that is being processed

A force-fed destructor ready for abomination

The vast solitude in him witnessed it all

Those self afflicting eyes

And their fear painted faces

Made out of utter discipline, failure unacceptable

Hosts to oblivion

Exploring the darkest of places

Stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck

Every day seemed like an endless night

When would he ever wake from this void

No other voice than his own will ever tell

What was real and where he had been

What he had done

Did you bleed for the cause

Like the rest of his men

Did you capture the euphoria

How it was like to kill

Such a necromantic force behind it all

They sure did battle till the end

But when came all the glory

And who got spared to carry his body

Just pure death and too profound to be shared

Was it all a fabricated vision in his memory

To serve the wastelands of insanity

At the front

Life forever lost its innocence

Never to see the light of day again

He pondered his last few steps

Into the realms of death

With his hands bloodstained

Courage and consistency

Bravery and valor

Honor and pride

For what was it all worth

*The battle raged on and on

Fueled by the venom of hatred for man

Consistently, without the eyes to see

By those who revel in sewer equally

We, the prosperity of the future seal

Cloaked by the thunders of the north wind

Born to capture the essence of

The trails of our kind

Zero tolerance must be issued forth

Behind the enemy's line

So it shall be written

And so it shall be done

Discover and conceive the secret wealth

And pass it unto your breed

Become your own congregation

Measure the sovereignty of its invigoration

We, who not deny the animal of our nature

We, who yearn to preserve our liberation

We, who face darkness in our hearts with a solemn fire

We, who aspire to the truth and pursue its strength

Are we not the undisputed prodigy of warfare

Fearing all the mediocrity that they possess

Should we not hunt the bastards down with our might

Reinforce and claim the throne that is rightfully ours

Consider the god we could be without the grace

Once and for all

Diminish the sub principle and leave its toxic trace

Once and for all

*Annihilate!

The commotion breeding the perverse

For bloodbath is on your doorstep

A mass impending threat

The perfection of religion

Becoming our death

Do not respond blindly

To growing gardens in decay

Stand guard when visitors fall silent

Blow the candles out, end the road here

No solace will be found

Within elements of the tribe

When covered with filth from all sides

Compassion will fail

Their promises are honored

In a mind controlled state

The absence of reality, reason and logic

Prove failure of faith

Enriched by the presence of its clarity

Darkness descends, everyone dies

For wisdom aligns in our favor

Illuminated before our eyes

Uncover!

A new beginning, the inevitable dawn

Justice will be given where justice is due

And guide the righteous ones

Back to the final resting ground

To perceive the truly hell bound

Demonstrate superiority

A grand gesture of liberation need no judge or jury

Demons rate inferiority

Scatter the remains of the prey

*Rise up

Let us fight

The thought away from our backs

And seed

On a cursed land

A lineage of pain

Then to burden

The of the merciful

Who believe in

The bread of the soulless

For the faith you posses

Is nothing but disgust and arrogance

And your need for knowledge

Is an abundance of mockery and desecration

The pain in my heart is not thirst

For a heavenly body

Nor is the failing search for angelic power

It is the fire and it burns

It's just that you

Are in its way

Take part in the shadow of guilt

Please your soul with the wonders of sin

For where will you be

When the lamp is extinguished

But death comes not

With our message

Reverberations from the splendid inheritance

Will redeem the eternal corruption

Bring judgement over heads other than your own

Where you hide your shame in songs of praise

Then you shall taste the fruit

Of your own passing away

Like a flock of hell spawns

And stewards of the son of despite

We parry their guile with the magnificence of disgust

By the evidence of our heavy burden

Lies their mind drowning

Left desiccated without power

*Let us sit by and watch

Death and destruction's devotees revel

Let us sit back and witness

Innocent semen being poured

Into the arms of Armageddon

Let it pour, more and more

Pure fucking Armageddon

Let it pour more and more

Reason faithfully defiles

On bloodstained hands

Where graceful motion

Are lost arts

There are only battles to be lost

In the kingdoms of the blind

For those who seek salvation

In the dust of the earth

Will only find wrath

In the sands of time

Engulfed by the desert

We taste death in the dry heat

The disciples of prophetic ablution

Had sworn to let the skeptics bleed

For great are their love for warfare

Henchmen of the disastrous creed

Watch us all celebrate in their name

The lambs of our time being slain

Awaiting the final perdition

Defeat against all and everything

For whatever adorned righteousness

Justice never wait for the guilty to speak the truth

For mankind so hated the world

That it gave all its begotten sons and daughters

That whoever believed the lie

To perish and receive everlasting hell

*Man and his faithful ethics

Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth

Diabolical fanaticism, so cold and grim

The perfect perversion, bestiality incarnate

As instruments of torture

And leaving no room for sympathy

We bring forth the monstrous birth

To the worlds light

As all great art is made from suffering

So are we

Good in nature, but evil by our own free will

Incestuously created by the will to kill

Time is here to walk the final abyss march

Bound to the force of the last holocaust

Pour free the gifts of grace

And slaughter the entire human race

Not permitted to redemption

When pain rises high in purgatory

A reality so convincingly justified

Feeding from Death Cult's gown

We bring forth monstrous birth

To the worlds light

*Unclean is the unfolding and thought of the act

Without limitations in unknown ecstasy

Nor a justified wish of giving birth to offspring for God

Voluntary infected and soaked with acid

In fleshy sweetness

Imprisoned by lies and disobedience

Man's fragile behavior

Must be strained with honor and glory, it's told

But goodness brought nothing but eternal evil

When the tyrant of Eden granted the fruit

Wisdom is freely enriched in the multitude of the Beast

When heaven's glorious injustice

And pompous mercy

Invokes discarding as we are seen

The spark has started a fire

And suffering in the will of pestilence

The pathetic slaves kneeling in shame

Born with sin and mercy

Descendants who swear the oath

With a promise to undo the peace

To crush the richness of heaven's slaves

And triumph in coldness in honor of the Beast

The chalice of wrath is flowing over

Strengthened by rioting devils' Sulphur winds

Glowing, from the region of Belial's children

Bred beyond the defying mountains of indignation

The last signs of Christ's losing angels

Burning inexorably in the fire of the raven

Painful and pale is death

With hematemesis from the guild of light

Death's presence spares no one

The devout life is suffocated by its own tongues

The most precious soil is garnished

With poverty and hunger

Wings spanned over Darkness' deep abyss

Brought to life to devour

With pestilence and death

Indulging on sin and whorery

The supremacy of the bastards of the pole

Finds pleasure in the hierarchy of sin

An eternal life in paradise

Is perfection in Satan's dynasty

*Are you born from the abyss

And have you sought the creed

That drape the shadows

Of your own thought?

Is your heart mesmerized

By the fire that burns forevermore

And do the secrets from the flames

Hold the mysteries over which you preside?

Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength

Free your spirit from those who lead in praise

Recollect the anger and the hate

For not shall your morals dissolve in pity

Righteous warmth accompanied

By deceitful tongues

Stay away from processed promises

Let them fear what you know

A malicious smile on their lips

To keep us all under control

Now it's time to rise and demand our due

The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold

Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways

Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray

Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes

The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect

Better lead than being led, earn any victory

For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass

The burden of proof rests on your shoulders

*As mortal manufactured waste

And part of the commonly infected

You prevent the ones worthy the gift of life

To surface on once a prosperous soil

As superficially bewildered whores

And succumbing to fictional truth

You are taught to preserve and profit

The life institutional lie

You worthless piece of shit

May we all depart from this world

And dissolve into nothingness

Compassion will not be granted

When life's value

Is point below zero

Human depravity is at our disposal

As the perfect tool to destroy mankind

The worst kind of them all

Modern times' ignorance, the world disease

Appeal to death of every man

A living hate smoldering abyss

Nurtured through centuries with quietly exercised wrath

Seeks the easiest way to the feed the engine

Praising the final bloodbath

Uncertainty and guilt

Will no longer endorse our fate

There will be no remorse, we kill to kill again

Killing all

Go ahead end it all, we deserve no better

As a forever unblessed detonation

The great plutonium chord fulminates

Blinding the eyes of creation

Cutting off all life support

Sweeping away existence instantly

Iced desolate ruins linger

Leaving traces of our lovely humanity

*The memories far beyond the reckoning

Have begun to lurk in the distance

Like visual objects dearly known

The grace of devils hands

As they walk with me like a medium

When I choose and require a burn-out

Resting in expanded malicious force

Drained for murderous weapons

Knowing where you stand

In the magnitude of this thought

Looking at the spirit of fire and flames

Enduring on the throne of the black heart

A bringer of evil I am

And therefore also a carrier of light

As I use this focus through the dark

And face the sunshine in the dead end

Limitations do not exist

When you are ahead of the crowd

With the art of confidence

I reign at the throne of my soul

The value of this darkness unwinds

Travelling the other path

A hidden triumph

But obvious to the strong and wise

By understanding this reality

I remain in a twice-colored cloud

With feet connected solid in the ground

And thus I get peace of mind

A bringer of evil I am

And also a carrier of light

As I use this focus through the dark

And face the sunshine in the dead end

*Devoted to your own opiate

In escapades from discontentment

Are you shutting off from the outside world

To reflect on your mind shallow gutter?

For this is your empire, this is your intrigue

Here you own them all, here you seal the deed

Contaminated from the spree of self salvation

To keep the fever flowing in the veins

Prominently manipulating heaven and hell

Does your sophistically discreet interlude

Maintain stories not to be revealed?

In your search for redemption

Greed and lies become the savior

Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand

For are not these the windows to your soul?

Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay

Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust

The dormant prodigy seeks its reason for rebirth

But it will never, never gain the strength

A surrender in superficial scorn

The rape of an ever unborn

Seeds have been planted in the name of the son

Until this day, ungodliness is yet to be gone

Sacramental suicide amidst the flow of virgin vine

The only way to comfort the defeat

Regrets can no longer find its ways

Streams of innocent bitter tears flowing down the drain

Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes



In Sorte Diaboli

*My descent is the story of everyman

I am hatred, darkness and despair

My descent is the story of everyman

I am hatred, darkness and despair

Evoked and entertained through centuries

Wrathful and sullen -- Dormant still

The ferocity pervades everywhere

Waiting to be released at last

Hear my offering

Ye bastard sons and daughters

Share my sacrifice

Share my sacrifice.

My descent is the story of everyman

I am hatred, darkness and despair

Reconcile not with the fear of the snake

But embrace it as your own

Inject its venom into your veins

And replant the seed that gives growth

Still shrouded in mystery

Until you arise above perception

A veil of ignorance is in motion

Continuing throughout generations

(A veil of ignorance is in motion

Continuing throughout multiple generations

Let me be the one that deliver you from the deceit

And back into perfect accordance with the laws of nature)

The snake is notoriously tempting

But the snake is fair

What is worse than not knowing?

To live or disappear?

The ferocity pervades everywhere

Waiting to be released at last

Hear my offering

Ye bastard sons and daughters

Share my sacrifice

Share my sacrifice

*Hence I will anoint

And whisper wholeheartedly

The creed of Hades and beyond

As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I cannot enslave myself

With imaginary words of salvation

The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple

Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity

Signify my chosen legacy

I was born to opposition

A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli

In Sorte Diaboli

In Sorte Diaboli

In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins

I will ask no forgiveness

For my sins

They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly

Stand by my confession

I voice your rebellion

Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this Kingdom

I will be the One

To outlive His time

With the triumph of free will

*Fallen I have, Fallen I am

Cursed and destined to burn

Fallen I have, Fallen I am

Cursed and destined to burn

My loyalty towards a liar ceased to exist

Once misled by an empty fraudulent face

I will never turn my back on you

And deceive the flesh of our race

I will always speak truly

So you can understand

No riddles that manipulate

The words and symbols of man

Do not believe false promises

Conspiring to cover up the truth

Find solace in darkness within yourself

And have your legions unleashed

Do not withhold the air

Of your very last breath

In the end of days

You will transcend life and death

Let the one who is fit

Be the King

Of the Heavens above

And all worlds down below

*From who or what have I

Received this gift?

For what purpose do I

Seduce this craft?

I know these answers

Lie hidden beyond

The powers that be

The power that is me

I will continue to decipher

And make it easier for you

Behold! Let it be told

Try and understand

That all and everything

Which I have done

I have done for you

I will continue to decipher

And make it easier for you

Behold! Let it be told

What is fiction and untrue

I will not leave you behind

With the burdens of belief

And divine misery

That means restless grief

For it is written

The times of old will come anew

And have the universe reversed to its origin

When the ancient winds blew

*Have I not

Been too long in the shadows of invention and creation

As I rightfully behold the flesh

Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing away

My word and world holds ground and is real

Your word is like floods of poisoned water

A language spoken with spit from different tongues

It all seems like an eternity

This battle between us two

"Good and evil"

Me and you

Time has come to step up

And take back what you took from me

My word and world holds ground and is real

Your word is like floods of poisoned water

A language spoken with spit from different tongues

You can never corrupt me again

Time has come to step up

And take back what you took from me

You can never corrupt me again

I protect every man guilty of sin

The ultimate sin being me

The vapor from the plague

That infested my mind, body and soul

Obscured my view from wisdom

The mist that had me wonder in resentment cleared

And troubles me no more

*Vengeance is mine

Neither sweet nor kind

Vengeance is mine

No longer am I held responsible

For the error of your ways

My conscience

Stand defiantly proud and rigid

So take my advice

Meet your opposition

Profane and disciplined

Take back your pride

With a pounding hammer

No longer am I held responsible

For the error of your ways

My conscience

Stand defiantly proud and rigid

So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh

No one puts me to the test

And as long as my spirit permits

There will be no fucking rest

Vengeance is mine

Neither sweet nor kind

Vengeance is mine

Vengeance is mine

I owe you nothing

But scorn and contempt

From all that is holy

I will have my revenge

Vengeance is mine

No longer am I held responsible

For the error of your ways

My conscience

Stand defiantly proud and rigid

So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh

No one puts me to the test

And as long as my spirit permits

There will be no fucking rest

With wisdom and fate

I design darkness

You keep feeding me denial and hate

And from that I will create

Arrogance and deception

Torment and bliss

How I envy your lack justification

When mine is so sincere

*I sense the darkness

The desire overtakes

My devotion endeavors

Habitation changing course

Repentance oh not

No name or remorse

Will I ever authorize

On this treasured path

I am warm by this fire

And its flaming desire

For what I cannot fulfill

My destiny completes

I believe my truth to be

A much greater thing

Than a manufactured lie

Too great to comprehend

Where I come from

There's no higher authority but me

Being my own god

Is all I was meant to be

Antichristus Spiritualis

Antichristus Spiritualis

*My eyes got blinded

And conned by the light

Like a fugitive on the run

I sought perseverance in the night

Deceptive icons were finally

Taken out of my sight

As the contender to origin

I will forever unveil His might

They say I am the cancer

On the back of the Inquisition

I may well be the cancer

In the heart of the Inquisition

They say I am the cancer

On the back of the Inquisition

I am the cancer

In the heart of the Inquisition

Through my years of sacrifice

Evolution came with lessons learned

Respect and fear

Is what I earned

So underestimate not your vision

Or you will be taught

Calculate your intuition

And you will teach

You all have been conned

And I always take the blame

For you do not understand

You are all the same

*Fear Tomorrow's Adversary

And the wealth of uprising

The final storm will be released

And the unmerciful will erect

Hidden from the eyes of your God

I will proclaim original sin

And have you all purged and purified

From the lies that remain within

Cleansed and draped in Sulphur linen

Black and pure since the Beginning

Mercy is not truth

Your sins are next to mine

Mercy is not truth

All your sins are next to mine

My soul's ablaze

Inflamed with rage and isolated

In whirlwinds of hate

My soul's ablaze

Yet camouflaged in the haze

Why did He not see this coming

What did He not understand

One time forsaken

But forgotten I am not

I will win this war

But never the peace

I am my own free spirit

Hence I will not rest

Sparks fly and fire licks my wings

Tied to this wood - I was born for burning

I rebelled against the flock

Declined to submit to slavery

As a token from my legions of the chosen few

I reveal the secrets to the world's most famous forgery

As flames devour my skin

Flesh melting - peeling off

My days as an earthbound entity

Are outnumbered and have come to an end

I will never be laid to rest

But be free from oppression

Those of my kin - the black flame

Those of my sin - hail my name

Those of us that have been given eyes to see

Will never be laid to rest but be free from oppression

In this hour I finally separate

Carnal knowledge from divine will

In this hour I finally separate

Myself from your tyranny

Still our enemies will keep hiding

In the shadows with betrayal against reason

But with my reprisal I shall endure

And uncover the magnitude of this treason

I will arise from perdition

And let me presence known

I will author a new era

And have my Beast shown

My stigma is of damnation

I am from beyond your God



Abrahadabra

*With defiance and resistance

I burn the bridges and their names

Will I ever comprehend

My own spells and games?

Let me keep my world

Let me have my slaves

They all do wonders for me

So I can leave things be

Let me keep my world

As I'm too blind to see

When I lay in bed at night - Wishing well

When I pray for recovery - Feeling hell

Suffocating in my own filth

With no fresh air to inhale

Born treacherous!

Insanity keeps me away and free

From the core of responsibility

But once the pace quickens

I'll be derived from myself

In total mind captivity

*The core principle of freedom

Is the only notion to obey

The formulae of evolution and sin

Leading the way

The rebirth is near completion

As we slowly awaken from slumber

The malpractice of the spirit ends

Untouched within us - Bleeding

The light that shines forevermore (forevermore)

*Old dreams return

Disillusioned I yearn

Am I buried beneath sand and clay?

The caress of cold soil

With limbs crippled to the coil

Locked inside a nightmare womb

Tarnished and grief stricken

Emptiness within a void

Longing for the sun to shine

To discourage the demonic

Salvation!

Darkness reborn!

We seem to keep fading away

Holding on to that last final sway

A doctrine of self salvation

Darkness reborn on resurrection day?

Stagnating in dead waters

While circling above the surface

Of the deep pale desert sea

Cutting that other life of lines

Salvation!

Wish we'd never met

Salvation!

And rather gone our separate ways

Salvation!

All times spent together

Salvation!

Are the darkest of days

Salvation!

Darkness reborn!

Meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it

As we only compete with ourselves

Left is that of a confident union

What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn

Deceit is everywhere you turn

We weed out the weak and their weep

Evolving - Compulsively

Behaving - Inconsistently

Yet the pulse is pounding

Restoration is the name

For those who are left in the game

Invocation in the name of our flame

Dimmu Borgir!

Forward onward march!

Forgive we shall not

Forget we shall not

With trickery and treat

Enemies will face defeat

No place for dreamers

As our formation is lava

Fire is with or against you

And so it burns

Constant retribution calling

From the shadows of three consecutive sixes

Merging with the cold dark vacuum

Talent is worthless unless exercised

"When the world is turning

You'll find your true nature

When the first is last and the last is first

You'll be where you choose to be"

Forgive we shall not

Forget we shall not

Fire is with or against you

And so it burns

BM has a violent past, mirrored in modern popular culture.Introduction

	On June 6, 1992 an arsonist set alight the Fantoft Stave Church near Bergen, Norway and subsequently drove the controversy and attention surrounding Norwegian Black Metal into a frenzy. In August of the same year the Norwegian Black Metal solo project Burzum recorded an EP, Aske (“ashes” in Norwegian), which was released in March 1993. The album cover prominently featured a photograph of the 12th century church as a charred specter of its former, humble self. And, as if to say to those involved in the Black Metal scene “Now you, too, can be as evil as you are supposed to be,” the first 1000 copies of Aske sold were accompanied by a lighter (cite something). In doing research for my original topic of Norwegian Black Metal’s effect on religious attendance in Norway, I realized that the hilariously over-the-top gore, desire for destruction, and constant theatrics on display in the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse (featuring the Death Metal band, Dethklok) had been at least partially inspired by true events.

The cartoon band strives to become ever more “metal”.In the cartoon, the band’s hyper-popularity has made them the 9th biggest economy in the world, enabling them to spare no expense in their search of deeper, darker, more brutal metal. As an example, Dethklok commandeered a nuclear powered submersible in order to record an album “inside the ocean. In the heaviest, deepest, most brutal part: The Mariana Trench!” (“Dethwater”). Because “fish don’t gots no good metal to listens to [sic]”, they capitalize on the billions of fish just waiting for good metal and produce an album, for fish, with titles like “Murmaider”- a track about mermaid murder. 

In real life, Norwegian Black Metal band members also sought the authenticity gained by pushing the boundaries of what was “brutal” or “metal” by cutting themselves during performances, burying their stage clothes for days at a time to adopt a smell of death and decay, burning churches, and in rare cases, murder. One early member of the Norwegian Black Metal

Real tactics by BM artists to become more “brutal”

Real tactics by BM artists to become more “brutal”band Mayhem who went by the name, ‘Dead’, shot himself in the head with a shotgun while he was alone in a house he shared with other band members. His suicide note was comprised of song lyrics and an apology that read “sorry about all the blood”. His body was discovered by fellow mayhem member Øystein ‘Euronymous’ Aarseth, who took pictures of Dead’s body before he called authorities, and it seems the claims that he made necklaces out of pieces of Dead’s skull have been verified by member of other bands in the scene (cite something). Aarseth opened a Black Metal record shop called Helvete (Norwegian for “Hell”) which became one of the very few central meeting spaces for those involved in the scene. Shortly afterwards he was murdered by Varg Virkenes, possibly over record profits or in retaliation to death threats made

Explains BM no longer violent in practice, leads into thesis for first timeThankfully, the extreme violence as well as the intense media presence that accompanied the genesis of Black Metal in Norway only lasted a few years. While Black Metal is still alive and well in its true, original form (both in local pockets and transnationally) and the overall lyrical and contextual themes remain largely unchanged, it quickly became clear to the entire scene that the sort of violent behaviors that defined those early years were no longer sustainable on any scale. One could argue that this trend towards less violent behaviors being prescribed by the “authentic” members of the scene was an early indication that as time went on, whatever intense emotions that allowed the violent actions to occur had faded. This, on a larger scale, forms the basis of this paper. 

In this paper I aim to provide a brief history of and context for Black Metal, describe its musical characteristics and some previous scholarly work, and attach a formal definition to the word “scene”. Further, I argue that an analysis of the lyrics of Norwegian Black Metal band Dimmu Borgir with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015) software will exhibit a

In stark contrast to the flash and fizzle of violence, Dimmu Borgir have released nine albums over 22 years, ample time to detect the influence of the positivity effect.

Introduces DB and begins musical discussionDimmu Borgir is one of the most popular and influential Norwegian Black Metal bands of all time. The band officially formed in 1993, close to when much of the violence associated with what is called the 2nd wave of Black Metal had died down and the Black Metal scene had developed a solid musical and social foundation. By this time, some Black Metal bands had begun to branch out and pursue their own visions of what was more extreme within Black Metal.

BM’s musical markersMusically, Black Metal had its characteristics: typical four piece “rock” band makeup (vocals, guitar, bass, drums), almost unintelligible throat-growls for vocals, multiple time signatures, heavy “blast beat” drumming, “tremolo” guitar picking, and low production value.

Historical reasons for BM’s thematic content

Historical reasons for BM’s thematic contentThematically, Black Metal took cues from what is referred to as the “New Wave of British Heavy Metal” as bands like Black Sabbath and Venom explored more mystical and esoteric content, especially those with a religious tone. As Kahn-Harris notes a fragmentation started in Metal in the 1980s and:

this fragmentation initially occurred in two directions. One was towards the mainstream and the “pop” and “glam” metal popularized by bands such as Poison. The other direction was towards what Weinstein calls the “fundamentalism” of what became known as “thrash” or “speed” metal.

	Fundamentalism implies a disgust at decadence (in this case the decadence of pop metal) and a desire to return to a perceived state of purity. (2)

Genre always changing, incl DB, long career	“Genres are not and cannot be static,” Kahn-Harris writes. “In both lay and academic forms of popular music writing, genre has taken on a more holistic meaning, covering both the music that is produced and the style in which it is produced. Genre is both a set of musical events and the social processes and communities that constitute that event” (2007:12). Some bands eventually branched out thematically into Viking or Pirate Metal, some played faster and with still lower production value in a manner reminiscent of Thrash Metal, while other bands like Dimmu Borgir added synthesizers, increased production value, and even incorporated full orchestras. Dimmu started to increase production value on their 1999 album Spiritual Black Dimensions and really committed to it in 2001 with their fifth album, Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia. The band has won several Norwegian Grammy Awards, established a global following, and continues to produce music and tour to this day. At 22 years, Dimmu Borgir has one of the longest lasting Black Metal careers of all time. Despite going through several lineup changes, there are two founding members who remain in the band, Shagrath (vocals) and Silenoz (guitar).

In addition to this, the initial prod for the idea of this study came from a personal reading of Dimmu’s lyrics and an off the cuff observation of different looking language, which I interpreted as sort of a mellowing out; a more introspective feel than an antagonistic one; perhaps the album seemed more subdued or to take a broader context into consideration (but staying within Black Metal themes). There appeared to be a certain awareness of the multi-dimensionality inherent in human existence

Insight to desire for and disdain for constancyNot all metalheads are fans of Dimmu, however. There are plenty of fans who (as they display the dichotomous themes rife in Black Metal) simultaneously accuse them of forsaking the true roots of the music by adding synthesizers, and of needing to “grow up” and get rid of their “corpse paint” stage makeup and medieval-inspired costumes. As is common in underground or burgeoning music scenes when an act makes it big, many have suggested that Dimmu’s slight deviance from Black Metal’s norms and progression toward richer, fuller (and more socially acceptable) sound was motivated chiefly by monetary interest, making them guilty of “selling out”.

BM out of rock and heavy metalBlack Metal is merely one pit-stop on the huge branch of the evolutionary tree of music that stems from the Rock and Roll period around the 1950s. It incorporates the mystical and religious themes of 1970s Heavy Metal (e.g. Black Sabbath) as well as the fast, distorted guitar present in early 1980s Punk and Thrash Metal, and many other artifacts from other genres.

BM originates in Norway as reaction to stability

BM originates in Norway as reaction to stabilityIt is, however, a unique product of Norway. There are many theories on the ways in which Norway provided the environment for Black Metal to thrive. Some authors suggest that, among other things, a growing romanticism of the Viking past, concern over immigrants, rejection of Christianity, and a limited set of modes of expression all played a role in the Black Metal formation process. Olsen argues:

Black metal emerged in Norway because of its wealth, peace and stability.

Norway is perhaps the best example of the successful, stable, modern state; the embodiment of the mundanity, lack of meaning and purpose that black metalers feel is synonymous with contemporary culture. Norway offered black metalers a safe, comfortable, stable life; black metalers set fire to Norway’s offer and tried to destroy everything associated with that safety and stability. Black Metalers found contemporary Norway, perhaps the greatest triumph of the modernist project, wholly unsatisfying and unacceptable. Black metal suggests a dramatic reevaluation of the self, other people and the basic nature of reality. Black metal defines itself in direct opposition to the stable modernity of contemporary

BM commonly in conflict between group and indiv identityOlsen recognizes a conflict key to the Black Metal scene and writes:

The conflict between individuality and group identity is one that particularly challenges contemporary culture and black metal in particular. Rhetoric regarding the importance of individualism, self-creation, and subjective morality are primary to black metalers all over the world. Some of this rhetoric is borrowed from the Church of Satan, some from the ideas of Frederic Nietzsche, and much from a widely distributed social Darwinist discourse, but all of it attempts to address problems with group identity and the power of the individual that have been significant to much 20th century discourse. (2008:4)

Racist or nationalist tones in BMTo characterize black metal as a necessarily racist or fascistic culture is to drastically oversimplify the ambiguous, often contradictory nature of racist and nationalistic discourses within black metal. It cannot be ignored, however, that black metal is produced largely by Europeans. Black metal’s fan base and more recent incarnations outside of Europe are far less heterogeneous however.

He goes on to explain that:

Satanic black metalers often perceive the war, death and anguish that result from racism and Nazism as happy accidents caused by a misguided and contemptible herd mentality.

Specifically, safety and security concerns are more salient in threatening and uncertain times, which causes people to make decisions that are more pragmatic and utilitarian. Thus, more meaningful themes and mature characteristics should be preferred during these threatening conditions to help reduce threat and uncertainty. Conversely, when times are more certain and less threatening, preferences for more meaningful thematic content and mature characteristics are less necessary, so themes and items related to fun, celebration, and the expression of carefree

Like Pettijohn and Sacco, I can consider song lyrics as a way of dealing with uncertainty, and I can simplify or modify their study to the point where I am merely making the assumption that the people who participate in the Black Metal scene are constantly feeling subjected to threatening social and economic conditions, with the goal in mind to draw parallels between their work and mine and work with another set of tentative predictions..

SST is part of theoretical framework

SST is part of theoretical frameworkOne theoretical framework with which to examine some changes in the emotional content in Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics over their career is Carstensen’s socioemotional selectivity theory: 

In which reduced rates of interaction in late life are viewed as the result of lifelong selection processes by which people strategically and adaptively cultivate their social networks to maximize social and emotional gains and minimize social and emotional risks. In the socioemotional selectivity model, social patterns observed in old age reflect gradual changes that unfold over the life course. The theory is rooted in the functions of social contact and, . . . posits that although the basic functions of interaction remain consistent across the life span, place in the life cycle influences the salience and effectiveness of specific functions. (1992:331)

Carstensen’s team interviewed 50 subjects of a longitudinal child-guidance study that had spanned 34 years at the time and is continuing today and found that: 

In young adulthood, having interactions with a wide range of people is probably highly functional. Entry into adulthood is a time in life where much information can be obtained from casual social interaction. In addition, lifetime mates and close friends are being identified from the broad range of available partners. In this sample, the most dramatic decline in interaction frequency occurred in the acquaintance category from age 18 to 30 By 30, subjects were much more focused on a select group of social partners. All but 4 of the subjects were married, and most had children. At this age, interactions with close friends also declined, but, interestingly, emotional closeness to them did not suffer. Emotional bonds with close friends continued despite reductions in contact. (1992:336)

Positivity effect under SST, over time people “mellow”

Positivity effect under SST, over time people “mellow”	Grounded in the socioemotional selectivity framework is the “positivity effect” which “concerns the relative difference between older and younger people in attention to and memory for positive as opposed to negative material” and:

According to SST, a core constellation of goals operates throughout adulthood, including basic goals associated with attachment and control as well as goals associated with instrumental needs and emotional gratification. The key postulate of SST is that the relative importance of goals within this constellation changes as a function of future time horizons. (Reed and Carstensen 2012:1)

	In a recent study, Mikels and Shuster had subjects provide a continuation to a story as the main character in the middle of an ambiguous situation and their analysis revealed “that older adults interpreted ambiguous scenarios with less negativity relative to the young, which is

Describes what LIWC does and why it’s appropriate for this studyTo analyze Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics, I chose to use the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC, Pennebaker et al. 2015), which “counts words in psychologically meaningful categories. Empirical results using LIWC demonstrate its ability to detect meaning in a wide variety of experimental settings, including to show attentional focus, emotionality, social relationships, thinking styles, and individual differences”. They go on to remark, “The words we use in daily life reflect what we are paying attention to, what we are thinking about, what we are trying to avoid, how we are feeling, and how we are organizing and analyzing our worlds. The 80 language categories in LIWC have been linked in hundreds of studies to interesting psychological processes” (Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010:24).

Song lyrics a place for intentionality	I would argue that song lyrics, especially song lyrics from such a marginal group with very strict rules of citizenship, would reflect a greater intentionality and therefore will be just as good or better suited for the type of analysis LIWC provides, supported by Pettijohn and Sacco’s statement, “Lyrics are an important form of communication, serving a variety of purposes as documented in the psychology of language literature. Lyrics tell stories and communicate with audiences in a manner similar to how people have conversations with each other” (2009:298). A number of similar studies have examined song lyrics alongside LIWC’s analysis, from which I have derived some clues about basic psychological traits associated with language apparent in data from LIWC.

LIWC analysis of other lyrics	Lightman, McCarthy, Dufty, and McNamara gathered lyrics of both songwriters who had committed suicide as well as a contextual living counterpart’s to which they had been matched, with a total corpus of 560 songs. It is a valuable study and important to the background of this paper, but it yielded a mix of positive and negative results that may or may not be transferrable to the interpretation of Dimmu Borgir’s lyrics. Notably, they write:

While most psychoanalytic literature suggests that suicidal individuals are preoccupied with thoughts of death and the interminability of the present, the suicide group used significantly more future-tense verbs and fewer death-themed words than the non-suicide group. 

The suicidal group’s lower usage of death-themed words might be partially explained by the therapeutic benefits of writing. Therapeutic writing is based on the idea that writing about negative emotions and events can be cathartic, and has been heavily implemented into counseling and research. (2007:1221)

Whether changes in U.S culture between 1980 and 2007 influence an understudied cultural product in ways that reflect these psychological transformations: word use in popular song lyrics. We predict that popular song lyrics will serve as cultural artifacts of shifts toward self-focus, social disconnection, anger, antisocial behavior, and misery commonly found in self-report research.

Previous research question that may apply to my study or future studiesThey (2011:202-203) ask questions about popular music that I would ask of Dimmu Borgir: Are lyrics becoming more self-focused over time (more first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns)? More socially disconnected (fewer words related to social interaction)? More angry and antisocial (more words in those categories and swear words)? Include less positive emotion (lower percentage of positive emotion words)? I use this study as a main reference for which data to look at and reasonable methods of interpretation as they displayed positive results. They close by writing, “The broader implication from these findings is that psychological processes and cultural products mutually reinforce each other to remain in agreement with generational changes in psychological traits, goals, and emotions” (2011:205).

	In another study, Pettijohn and Sacco looked at #1 Billboard songs from 1955-2003 and found using environmental security hypothesis, LIWC, and the general hard times measure that:

Popular song lyrics were predicted to have more meaningful themes and content when social and economic conditions were threatening. Trends for more meaningful, comforting, and romantic lyric ratings were observed in more threatening social and economic times. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software, songs with more words per sentence, a focus on the future, and greater mention of social processes and intergroup themes were popular during threatening social and economic conditions.

In addition to this, the chronology of album releases can appear to be different at certain times due to the re-release of an album. I wanted to analyze the albums as close to the form in which they originally appeared, so I enacted some discrimination criteria for songs. I chose original-release format of albums in order to isolate the closest thing to a linear timeline, so there is no special release or “geographical bonus” content included in the analysis. I chose to allow songs that appear on multiple albums because I believe despite whatever demands the label placed on Dimmu for album content, the bands have always had the final say in Black Metal, and therefore the duplicate songs are artifacts of intentionality, represent a conscious decision of how the band wanted to interact with the community, and will be treated as such. Some of the albums included cover versions of songs written by people outside the band, but as the songs were authored by other people they are not included in the analysis. There were also a number of songs across the different albums that are instrumental, had no translation, or had not

Though an official translation would have been a better choice, www.darklyrics.com provided user-submitted translations, as well as user-submitted corrections to those translations (and to all lyrics in general). There is some risk here of invalidating any results I may find due to the issues present in things like word choice and semantics that can be difficult to accurately translate. LIWC includes multiple language dictionaries with which to analyze content, but as Dimmu officially started using English as their primary language on their third record, I wanted to keep things simple and use only one language at a time.

Final Essay

Part C) When Jessie little doe Baird says “It is not the language that is lost; it is you”, she means the dormant state of the Wampanoag language is merely a symptom of the wider issue concerning Native American identity in practice. Staying in the linguistic frame of reference, the language can never be lost on its own, no matter the animacy attributed to it in the language. The people, the speakers, they are the ones who have been ripped away from their peaceful, sustainable lives and turned towards a different definition of “life”. They have been purposefully misguided and led away from that which tied their lives together- the language remains in various states, waiting for its people to come home again. This is essentially the message of all issues of Native identity reclamation and revitalization. The objects, practices, ways of thinking, the feelings of belonging to a group that fits the Native American “normal” have not disappeared of their own accord. It is the people who have been forced away from them, but the presence of revitalization and reclamation movements is an indication of a resurgence of pride in Native American identity, or at least a shift away from the cultural and linguistic shame created by the first wave of boarding schools and followed by generations of extermination policies. 

	The prevalence of type II diabetes in Native communities and particularly in Native children is a clear indicator that these people are “lost” and separated from how their lives were calibrated to be lived. (in)Tolerance to foods is such a clear indication of this due to the time depth required to develop these sorts of thresholds. Just like Arctic-living peoples cannot survive on a lean vegetarian diet, traditional horticulturalists like the Hopi cannot live well on ultra-processed foods- but were they to return to those heritage foodways, health outcomes would take an optimistic turn.

	In a different manner, one could say that those Native groups that require a person to trace their lineage to the Dawes Roles or on a certain percentage of genetic similarity for tribal enrollment are “lost” in two ways. First, neither recorded documentation nor genetics were any part of how Native American’s identified each other pre-contact (aside from Tribal or leadership histories, like those kept on wampum belts in the Northeast). They used languages and sociopolitical organization differences to tell who was who, the communal environment of reciprocity made it perhaps a little more likely to trust a group of strangers if they belong to a group known to be friendly. Second, it is less a case of being “lost” than one of being led astray for the purpose of the encroaching state, but using the Dawes Roles seems to me a particularly macabre way to assure lineage. Not only was the travesty of the Dawes Act enforced, but groups are using the remnants of a tool of annihilation to determine the makeup of their group now. Even though it can be seen as a case of “using the master’s tools against him”, it feels counter to how group membership was assessed and attained before contact.

	Alcoholism has long been a stereotype attributed to Native Americans, but to me it is a saddening display of generations of pain. Whether the individuals feel “lost” or they are reacting to the real loss of so much of their community, ancestors, and traditional ways of reconnecting to those things, using alcohol outside of ceremony is a post-contact phenomenon. The widespread abuse of alcohol, especially when considered along with cultural associations to alcohol (like the saying “never talk to a drunk Apache” because they are literally no longer themselves, or other groups notions that drunkenness is akin to death), is clearly a coping mechanism for incredible pain and sorrow. I just recently had experiences that really let me imagine a geographic location dear to me becoming no longer available- what kind of earth-rending pain did the Hopi feel when one of their mountain shrines was destroyed? I believe the term used in class was “spitting blood”. A return to traditional ways will not take away the loss, but as we have seen with the local “Wellbriety” enterprise and other revitalizations of culture, going home clears the path to healing.

	Finally, it could be argued that identity issues factor into every aspect of Native sovereignty, and due to the state’s fondness for and reliance on precedent, the effect of reclamation and revitalization movements on sovereign issues have limited power. Even just the act of gaining recognition at any level of government places the burden of proof of identity squarely at the feet of Native Americans. When seeking recognition (which is an internal group debate on its own and a hotbed for factionalism), Native groups must meet certain criteria put forth by the state and reckoned in a state court with laws of the state. Often these criteria fly in the face of the explicit goals of previous US policy- for example a common criteria of recognition is a culturally continuous presence on specific locales for certain lengths of time, despite US policies of cultural annihilation and forced geographic dislocation. The US led these people to fear the reaction to their existence so much many chose to abandon those ideas of identity.

	Contemporary Native Americans are still lost, but it is not their fault, nor is it the end for them- indeed, this can be the dawn of a new beginning. Their incredible resilience and ability to adapt has been demonstrated over and over, even in the face of genocide. Many of them, though faced with their own hurdles of personal and collective identity, choose to remember those things that lead back home.Language Revitalization Outline

Midterm Essay Questions 2 and 3

#2

	Early European incursions to Native America were faced not with an inviting, open, fertile land that was devoid of humans and ready to be parceled out and sold- instead, multitudes of indigenous people were revealed to be living on land that, while indeed fertile, was wholly unfamiliar and not a little intimidating to those early Europeans. The northeast coast generally, but especially the groups around what is now Massachusetts, Delaware, and Connecticut shared enough linguistic, cultural, and societal features that the Europeans painted a false picture for themselves of Native America on large scale. They assumed to some extent that what they witnessed of people in the east remained true for the rest of the “unexplored” lands, even (or maybe especially) as the U.S. accumulated more land to the west. This view of Native America persisted, again in various degrees, until around 1730 when Europeans finally made it across the Mississippi River heading west and the abounding diversity of Native American peoples could no longer be denied.

	As early anthropologists, naturalists, and armchair scholars came to experience and study the land and the populations it supported, certain concepts eventually sprung up that provided a comparative baseline to aid in those studies. Mark Sutton (2016:4) notes, “Researchers recognized early on that cultures in similar environments tend to be similar to one another, sharing some aspects of economy, politics, and even language”. I take some issue with Sutton’s assertion of what “early” entails here (and my own use at the beginning of this paragraph), it seems like a deflection of the more than two hundred years of willfully inhumane treatment that preceded the start of real studies about Native Americans. The term “culture areas” comes from Otis Mason’s work near the end of the 19th century that looked at similarities between geographical regions and cultural lifeways, though the idea had been around for some time before this. Boas also had ideas about local adaptation and eventually his student, Kroeber, refined and reworked the concept of culture areas, making important refinements along the way. 

	Kroeber’s work on culture areas, while relatively successful in minimizing some European preconceptions as well as illuminating Native American complexities, still leaves a questionable framework based on ideas mostly foreign to the people facing classification. I am not convinced that the culture area concept is entirely worth its usefulness as “a point of comparison and reference” (Sutton 2016:4). Sutton lists weaknesses “such as defining a single area that contains considerable cultural and/or environmental diversity, use of somewhat arbitrary criteria, the assumption that a static cultural situation exists, and the tendency to equate environment with cause” (4). More problems abound, but the one that carries the most weight comes from lecture: Culture areas are inherently Eurocentric in that they make use of European ideas of identity via political/geographic boundaries, whereas Native Americans differentiate each other by language and political structure. 

	There are arguments to be made about the precedent already being set by Native Americans naming themselves after areal or geographic features (i.e. ‘Wampanoag’- People of the Dawn or East), but it seems more the case that names like that are applied to groups from an external source (i.e. Salmon-Eaters or Swamp-Walkers). Culture areas fall directly in line with these acts of defining a people based on criteria relevant to the definers, instead of criteria relevant to those being defined. 

	I cannot decide if I am being post-modern, a pedant, or an idealist, but I am frustrated with culture areas. I am beginning to think about culture areas as an instance of “knowledge for the sake of knowledge” and an ultimately self-serving, convenient way of doing anthropology. The only people culture areas work for are the people who dreamed them up. What use are they to the Native Americans they claim to describe? Before Europeans, on the east coast things as seemingly inconsequential and ubiquitous like a fence were alien, unnecessary concepts that did not fit into with how Native people understand and live with the land.  Even if a Native group was trying to find out more about themselves because some of their history was obscured by cultural lag or periods of intense deculturation, culture areas seems to have more exceptions to the rule than cases of the rule itself, making it an untrustworthy technique for such work. Culture areas work for anthropologists as reference points, but I think this reinforces the incorrect notion that groups of people, Native Americans in particular, can easily be generalized. Under-motivated undergraduate students seem to be the people most likely to latch on to those generalizations and bandy them about as if they even begin to describe a people, much less define them (speaking from experience).

	I don’t know if there is a better way. I don’t even know if my argument holds any merit in light of the pragmatics of being able to compare groups in this way. In the end, my thoughts are on the dangers in the way European-derived science and its conclusions are portrayed: empirical, objective and free from bias, true. When will anthropologists move from telling people “this is who you are” to asking “who are you?”?

Table 1: Cultural Features of Crow, Pawnee, and Wampanoag (adapted from table in PowerPoint lecture by Dr. Linda Watts, 2016)



Table 1 displays some important cultural features from the Crow, Pawnee, and Wampanoag. The Crow and Pawnee are examples of two primary culture area adaptations in a single culture area: nomadic big-game hunting bands (Crow) and sedentary farming villages (Pawnee). The Wampanoag are an example of one of the primary northeast adaptations: semi-sedentary horticulture with seasonal fishing and hunting. Immediately of interest is the Crow subsistence strategy. 

Crow oral history contains stories of an argument within the Hidatsa that resulted in a fairly sizable division of the Hidatsa group, with the outgoing migrants eventually becoming known as the Crow people. Hidatsa are remarkably similar to Pawnee in their preference and degree of sociocultural influence surrounding sedentary riverine farming with seasonal hunts, while the Crow never returned to those practices once they split. Instead they used the horse to great effect, engaging in nomadic big-game hunts, raiding and trading with other nearby groups. 

The fertile coast encouraged the Wampanoag to engage in horticulture, the result is somewhat similar to the Pawnee and Hidatsa situations. One could argue that their farming practices extended into shellfish cultivation, or at least that reliance on coastal fishing and whaling encouraged a more sedentary way of life, though recent archaeological evidence (Hunter, Silliman, Landon 2014) suggests that unlike groups from the northwest coast, the Wampanoag and other groups like the Pequot exhibited, from time to time, a much lower dependence on marine foods as well as differing methods of waste deposit formation, likely favoring instead a larger winter and/or summer hunt. This difference in subsistence strategies and perhaps therefore in patterns in seasonal abundance may help explain the presence of Wampanoag clans without a “true” chiefdom and formalized redistribution ceremonies. From the Wampanoag tribal website, they “utilize the term to signify a tribal member or members associated with a designated talent or ability to help support the tribe” (pokanoket.us), more like roles than kinship, maybe closer to a sodality than to a lineage clan.

Also of interest is the tendency towards matrilineality exhibited by all the groups, especially because they seem to be results of different processes. For the Pawnee and Wampanoag, a division of labor was present that meant women spent the most time working the land. This is then combined with tendencies towards a seasonal ceremonial cycle influenced heavily by farming practices and the general metaphoric reflection of human life cycles in corn- especially recognizing women (and therefore corn) as life-givers. For the Wampanoag at least, women could become holders of political office (i.e. sachems) though often males filled that role and the power women wielded manifested in ways more subtle than European observers were accustomed. The Crow were matrilineal when they were Hidatsa, but much shifted in their migration and the following period. With raiding and being raided as constant, necessary activities, battle prowess became more and more valued, perhaps contributing to the power shift towards men. Definitely of consequence is the regular, sometimes prolonged absence of men from the tipi camps as they spent much of their time hunting and raiding, leaving the women to maintain the rest of Crow life. 

I feel a bit sheepish about my railing against culture areas in the first part of this essay now that I used the concept to root my own ideas. This is part of the problem for me and anthropologists in general- so much effort is required to be conscious of our biases that it is easy to rely on these often abstract tools that suit our ways of thinking, knowing, and being. This easiness, this convenience, this unrelenting focus on efficiency is certainly the enemy of good anthropology. 

#3 (note: this essay contains 2/3 of required examples, but is ~4 pgs)

	Native American rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements are all connected in that they work to empower the individual who will then work to empower the group. In this way, traditional cultural identities are closely intertwined with individual identities; If one’s Native identity doesn’t manifest and/or resonate at an individual level, the power of that identity cannot flow back into the group, and if the cultural presence of the group is so suppressed that it fails to inspire the individual, the same effect is likely. Persistence of Native traditions and identity resembles a positive feedback loop, while eradication of the same is the inverse- resistance or ambivalence to honoring a Native identity can only increase with time and perceived distance from a group, unless met with a revitalization movement or otherwise rekindled.

 Persistence of cultural tradition is the persistence of identity, and if we are to avoid the kind of true cultural annihilation early European invaders designed, both must be understood as vital. All these concepts have inherent power and meaning to Native Americans, but they are otherwise connected by the fundamental idea of sovereignty. Native self-determination, the (in)ability to be unto themselves, is at the heart of this discussion. In her introduction to Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England, anthologist and English professor Siobhan Sebier (2014) reminds her audience that the late stage of settler colonialism is political and economic subjugation “through policies designed to thwart self-governance” (2). As it stands, nearly all Native groups today have survived lengthy periods of fully external development and are in states of arrested development, though more and more are slowly regaining states of internal development and therefore, sovereignty.

To try to explain the general feeling for how I am thinking about the idea of sovereignty, I have to mention scenes from two films we viewed in class. Russel Means (Lakota, in Sacred Spirit) started things off when he pointed out the imposition of the European concept of time meant (among other things) that the priorities of Native Americans were no longer their own to control. He said, “If there is no time, then you have time for everything”- meaning without time, one is only beholden to oneself. This idea of non-control was bolstered by an Onondaga person (Winds of Change) discussing the fallout of being forced to participate in a cash economy. Their daily lives have been under constant interference from this alien way of living as they, too, are forced to prioritize differently. Some feel like they have to choose between either preparing for traditional ceremonies, or wage work or other foreign time commitments. As a result, individuals are removed from their Native communities and their support systems in the name of paid work, inadvertently continuing the structure of U.S. (internal) colonialism. 

	Much of what rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements concern falls into the category of “how to be a [insert group name here]” or like Keith Basso (1990:117) remarks about the Western Apache’s historical tales, “what it means to be an Apache, or, to make the point less dramatically, what it is that being an Apache should normally and properly entail”. These are marked, conspicuous activities, therefore we can say they are inherently different to the default group’s (Euro/Anglo/white) category of activities, and that their existence at all is itself an act of distinction- the individual, the proximal group, and finally the entire group population is each recognized as a separate yet integral part of a whole. Perhaps more importantly, the details of these activities can help highlight what remains important and vital to the cultivators of Native identities. 

	For example, during the Pueblo IV period (1300-1540) and the re-aggregation of people at the East and West Pueblos following the dissolution of Chaco, the Kachina tradition emerged as what appears to be a response to drought and an overall hard climate. It is possible more power was ascribed to them in the Western Pueblos than originally intended, as around this time the Eastern Pueblos took the brunt of Spanish aggression. The Pueblo revolt (1680-1692) drove the Kachinas underground, but they weathered that conflict and survived nearly seven hundred years of constant oppression, where today they remain a vital part of life for several groups of the Southwest. The endurance of Kachinas, their ability to disappear in the eyes of outsiders while retaining (and probably growing) their spiritual power, their mechanisms of inter-group solidarity and subversion of the enemy all gather new meaning when viewed as a response to threat of cultural and personal annihilation. I think for lots of Native Americans in the Southwest (and elsewhere), that threat never truly went away. Kachina dances empower the individual Kachinas as well as the individual audience members, the specific pueblo/town/village where the dance is held, the entire group that is aware of the ceremony, and at the largest scale all Native Americans who are aware of the ceremony. They are all saying “we are still here and we know how to take care of our people”.

From this (very far) outsider’s view, whatever governing or aggregate representative body of a Native group can encourage and facilitate, to different levels (including not at all), individual participation in traditional activities. However, it seems like a lot of things are denied to groups with small populations, even more so for those small groups that remain in a state of geographic dislocation. Shifting from the Southwest to the Lakota Sioux, the focus seems to shift from empowerment to more of a “putting out fires” attitude, but that is a result of near-destruction rather than some sort of complacence. In Sacred Spirit, drum keeper Brain Thunder Hawk mentions moving to the city from the reservation to get away from “reservation problems”, gangs, and drinking as having huge impacts on the Lakota people. Especially powerful is his description of alcoholism as “our worst enemy”, where the “daily opportunity to become a victim” requires immense willpower that is unreasonable to expect from anyone. He uses his drum keeper status and other musical traditions of the tribe to “combat gang violence and anchor the young people”, which fits the idea of individual cultural engagement as means to a larger, centering, group-wide cultural presence.

	Native voices on Native identities rightly transcend any definition, feature attribution, or systematic analysis imposed on them by non-Native people. This is made clear by the heartfelt words of Lakota Sioux Cherokee Rose on trying to adapt to conflicting use of sacred space, “You may change and alter the face, the outside, the external part of it. But you can never change what’s inside me that makes me this way” (Sacred Spirit).

I’m lucky to have the fire of curiosity burn so fiercely within me and I feel a significant responsibility to use the heat of that fire to both provide comfort for and excite the diverse communities around me. For grades 2-8 I was homeschooled by my mom. Nearly all that time was spent reading- first working through what I could in our home library, then making multiple trips a week to our local library branch. Mythology was a constant subject of interest and noticing the themes common to all myths played a large part in readying me for the flexible perspectives required for the formal study of anthropology. I constantly have to navigate the dissonance of placing primacy on literary knowledge in my personal life and actively seeking out the insights intrinsic to other ways of knowing. I am pursuing two main objectives with Library and Information Science that will remain relevant regardless of the concentration I choose: 1) To practice and majorly build up my talents in synthesizing, distilling, analyzing, and interpreting y information (specifically textual/literary

Mid-Course Essay: Language, Cultures, Societies

	This essay contains five examples of Native American language or linguistic features that directly relate to cultural and/or social structures. Three specific Native American languages are discussed in the examples that represent Zuni, Wampanoag, and two cases from Western Apache. A fifth example examines the Southwest Pueblos in terms of language conservatism rather than one specific language or group. The essay ends with a brief discussion on why these cases matter in terms of Native identity.

Western Apache Verb Classification: Keith Basso’s (1990) fantastic work with the 

Western Apache added depth and clarity to existing linguistic studies. Especially important is his work on semantic dimensions of verb categories, which followed Mary Haas’ ideas on “covert cultural taxonomies” (1967, qtd. in Basso 1990:2), which suggests that there are “taxonomies whose constituent categories are labeled by linguistic units operating at ‘sub-lexemic’ levels” (Basso 1990:2). Through careful componential analysis Basso realized there are thirteen classificatory verb stems that make up seven semantic dimensions, marked by sixteen associated features.

Western Apache verbs differ from other Athapaskan verbs in that they “do not distinguish among categories of events but among categories of objects instead” (Basso 1990:1). They are concerned with the physical properties of objects, i.e. whether or not it can move of its own volition, can be carried by one person, is a long but not rigid object in a rigid container, etc.  To me it seems like the foremost concern is the degree to which an object lends itself to being transported. This would suit the history of the Western Apache as a highly mobile group, made even more mobile after mastering the horse, and fighting to retain those mobile lifeways well after contact and a sustained U.S. offensive. The Western Apache’s mobility is clearly of chief importance to them and their language reflects this notion. 

Zuni Kinship Terminology: The work done by Dr. Watts on Zuni social/relation classification is a clear example of huge chasms between indigenous and other ways of knowing and relating to the world. Every previous scholar that commented on Zuni kinship came with a strongly ingrained, nearly unconscious idea that nascent kinship was the only kinship and they failed to account for the possibility of difference. Dr. Watts realized that the Zuni used the same kinship terms across generations and peripheral relations not to complicate how they identify blood ties but instead to denote the relational role that developed between individuals. They indicate a social rather than genetic proximity, and are indicative of earned interpersonal responsibilities instead of a “right to relationship” by way of genetic relation.

Southwest Pueblos and Language Conservatism: The history of the Southwest is not completely understood, as several groups have had intermittent periods of habitation in, and migration out of, the area. It appears that some groups, displaced by an intense drought around 1275 AD, re-aggregated into different communities, including the historic Pueblos around the Rio Grande at the tail end of the Pueblo III period, and the reorganization extended into the Pueblo IV period. Some groups had been in the area for a long time, so this could be somewhat along the lines of people being attracted to fluorescent groups, which are the groups that are the best adapted to their specific ecological niche. The often demanding environment of the Southwest perhaps greased the wheels for bigger cultural changes, as people needed to modify their behaviors in order to survive. What we see with this coalescing of many different groups in the Southwest is an example of the common model of “unity in diversity” and perhaps an example of Sapir’s language lag- the idea that language changes more slowly than culture. Harsh periods of upheaval in the area meant groups were removed from the most familiar aspects of life, culture, and especially their homeland. In order to maintain the autonomy and separate identities that were represented, many of the groups engaged in varying degrees of language conservatism, steadfastly and consciously maintaining their languages. In this instance, though language and culture are deeply intertwined, language became a primary vehicle for unique identity and constitutes enough of what is culturally important to the people that they kept the language intact while their culture was modified.

Wampanoag Revitalization: In contrast to what happened in the Southwest, the contemporary Wampanoag live on ancestral homelands but were forced away from their language and much of their culture, resulting in a lengthy time of no native speakers and a language deemed “extinct” by scholars. That was never really the case, not only due to the huge amount of native writings in Wampanoag hiding in musty archives, but also because a “local indian dialect” (We Still Live Here) was still being used- some odd words and phrases mixed with English into a sort of pidgin, but importantly the vitality of Wampanoag language should never be in question. 

Language facilitates other ways of connecting to people like songs and ceremonies, but also ancestral connections, which are of foremost concern to the Wampanoag. With the rediscovery of native-authored texts, language was the key to reforging those connections and getting at what those older generations were about. For the Wampanoag, language revitalization awakens and brings to the forefront not only previously out of reach contemporary cultural aspects and feelings, but also their literal ancestors- they say language is the “only way to see or hear the ancestors” (We Still Live Here). In this case there was a rare physical link to them in the form of the native documents, but that link made full-scale language reconstruction a reality. 

Western Apache Discourse Features/Particles (Historical Tales): In Basso’s Stalking with Stories (1990), he explains the differences between Western Apache categories of speech (yat’i’) and, more importantly here, categories of narrative (nagoldi’é). Each category of narrative has a specific purpose and form, but historical tales (‘agodzaahí) are the only marked category of narrative in the discourse. Basso (1990:117-118) notes they are separated “by an opening and closing line that identifies with a placename where the events in the narrative occurred” (e.g. “It happened at ‘big cottonwood trees stand spreading here and there’”). While covert categories often hold a great deal of importance, overt categories can do the same. In this case, the marked historical tales are a primary means of socialization for the Western Apache. As indirect speech acts, they serve as non-confrontational means to correcting behavior. Basso writes, “Historical tales have the capacity to thrust socially delinquent persons into periods of intense critical self-examination from which (ideally, at least) they emerge chastened, repentant, and determined to ‘live right’” (Basso 1990:126).

Conclusion: These vastly different examples of language directly relating to culture and society are indicative of the key role language holds in how we go about being human. Whorf argued for the primacy of language in relation to culture, identity, and memory and as an individual’s basic orientation to the world, their worldview. Grammatical systems are like DNA coding: we use language to constitute the world and the world is constructed through language. Therefore, speakers of each language create their own, deeply personal world. The hope for a planet rich in diversity of thought is somewhat dwarfed by encroaching globalization, but that diversity will always be possible when the languages are maintained. I believe indigenous languages contain keys to a better, living world, and a much needed alternative to more popular ways of thinking. Einstein said “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels”, but it is clear to me that the thinking we need is not new at all.

Wôpanâak (Wampanoag): A Brief Look

Introduction

	In small, vibrant communities along the coast of Massachusetts, The Assonet Band of Wampanoag, The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, The Wampanoag Tribe of Aquinnah, and the Herring Pond Band of Wampanoag are stoking the fire of a linguistic and cultural reawakening. The Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project is working to repair some of the deculturation suffered by the Wampanoag and breathe new life back into the expression of Wampanoag identity by, among other things, cultivating the first generation of native Wôpanâak speakers in over 150 years.

Wôpanâak is one of several Algonquian languages in the Algic family (see Table 1) anchored to the Northeast, and the presence of relatively far-ranging, mutually intelligible dialects is one of several reasons the language is included in the genetic sub-group of Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA). Ives Goddard and Kathleen Bragdon (1988) summarize the linguistic area:

[Wôpanâak] is a [formerly] extinct Eastern Algonquian language spoken aboriginally and in the Colonial period in what is now southeastern Massachusetts. The Indians speaking this language are those referred to as the Massachusetts, the Wampanoags (or Pokanokets), and the Nausets, who inhabited the region encompassing the immediate Boston area and the area east of Narragansett Bay, including Cape Cod, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket. (xv)

According to David Costa’s (2007) work on SNEA dialectology, Frank Siebert is credited with first using the term in 1975, with Goddard’s 1978 discussion being the only other published work on the subject. Importantly, Costa (2007:84) argues that in addition to lexical similarities, “There are three main sound laws that are found in all and only the SNEA languages: palatization of PA [Proto-Algonguian] *k; the merger of PEA [Proto-Eastern Algonquian] *hr and *hx; and word final PEA *r → SNEA ŝ”.

The phonological innovations on display in table 2 give some more ideas about regional sound similarity. One of the more important broadly classifying features are the various reflexes of what Costa (2007) describes as PEA *r, and results in the isoglosses of N (Wôpanâak), L, Y, and R dialects seen on figure 1.

Short Grammatical Sketch

A Note on Sources

	The hardest part of any summarizing work is merely deciding what to include and what to exclude. That decision bogged down this project from day one, but worse was the frustration that came from not having enough linguistic knowledge to create a perfect product. The result is that I rely entirely on works by other authors (luckily two are Wampanoag members actively doing reconstruction), especially for examples in Wôpanâak, which are verbatim from Baird (2000), Hicks (2006), Costa (2007), and Goddard and Bragdon (1988). 

Written documentation of Wôpanâak started in the 17th century, first in conversion efforts like printing Wôpanâak Bibles and legal paperwork. A few Europeans delved more deeply into the language and produced dictionaries which, in addition to the Wôpanâak Bible, were important to revitalizing the language. More important, though, are the huge numbers of legal and other official documents written in Wôpanâak by Wampanoag people- the biggest corpus of Native written documents in the world (Makepeace and Baird ). 

Goddard and Bragdon (1988) described the corpus they analyzed of over one hundred native written documents in Native Writings in Massachusett: 

Deeds and other records of land transactions are the type of document best represented, others being records of town meetings and the decisions of special councils, depositions, wills, petitions, letters, notes, arrest warrants, a power-of-attorney, a notice of banns, and a preacher’s marriage record. Also included in the corpus are marginalia and other brief writings in books (principally Bibles) and two gravestones. (xvii)



Goddard and Bragdon produced a comprehensive sketch grammar from their analysis and Baird (2000:4) credits this work with saving the Wampanoag at least an extra decade of revitalization work. Baird’s introductory grammar also credits John Trumbull’s Natick Dictionary (1903) as vital to her work. The current Wôpanâak dictionary of over 11,000 entries is not publicly available, but I ambitiously obtained of a digital copy of Trumbull’s dictionary. Unfortunately, Baird (2000:4) warns it “leaves much to be desired”, and my limited experience with linguistics left me untrusting of working with the orthographic/phonological shifts between it and the revived version, and it was of limited use for this project. 

Typology

	Wôpanâak contains many polysynthetic elements, namely the use of a huge range of stems, affixes, and other morphemes, often creating inflected, densely packed words- especially verbs, which here also serve as adjectives. From their work in Native Writings in Massachusett, Goddard and Bragdon (1988:474) posit “The parts of speech, as defined by distinct patterns of subcategories and inflection are nouns, pronouns (of several types), quantifiers, verbs, and particles”, noting that “particles have no inflection”. 

Phonology

Wôpanâak phonology is particularly tricky to work with due to the sheer amount of individuals involved with the creation of the Native documents and time across which studies have been compiled. There are many different styles, insights, interpretations, and most annoyingly, transcription standards. Even between Baird’s introductory grammar and Goddard and Bragdon’s sketch, the differences quickly became confusing. Here I have copied Baird’s consonant and vowel chart, mostly for simplicity, but also to respect the architects of this revival.

The charts contain the IPA symbol in parentheses next to the orthographic symbol. She gives tips on pronounciation: /ty/ is like a palatalized /k/; a lone /e/ can sometimes be preceded by /u/ and create a /j/ sound in particular following consonants. For other ideas on what kind of sound changes are present, Baird made this chart on AI verb stems:

Verbs that…			have…				

End in a long vowel		-m in 1st sg, 2nd sg

End in ô			ô changing to â before w

Begin with a vowel		t inserted after prefix

End in -n			can get -w



Morphology

Nouns in Wôpanâak can function as subjects, objects, and more. Nouns are gendered as either animate (NA) or inanimate (NI). The animate category is not entirely obvious, nor is it marked in the bare form of any word; animacy is marked when the plural form of the word is taken and plural suffixes are added. 



In addition to gender and number (singular and plural, no dual), nouns can also be marked as obviative with the suffix -ah and absentative with the suffixes -ay (sg.) or -uk (pl,). Absentative NAs are deceased while absentative NIs are lost or generally no longer owned. Importantly, the plural, absentative, and obviative cases are mutually exclusive, with only one suffix being attached. Nouns are also able to take a locative suffix, -ut (in, on, at), which doesn’t distinguish number. Both NA and NI nouns contain sets of dependent or inalienable nouns which must show possession with prefixes. See paradigm tables for examples of possessive prefixes. These possessive prefixes are altered thus: for dependent, vowel initial nouns the prefix its ‘u’; nouns that vowel initial but not dependent receive an intrusive ‘t’ between prefix and stem; consonant initial nouns will ise the expected prefix unless it’s initial m, p, k, or w, in which case the third person prefix wu- drops its ‘w’ and becomes u-.

	Pronouns and demonstratives are also gendered via animacy. Pronouns must be used in certain situations, like in nominal sentences where the predicate is a noun instead of a verb, but in verbal sentences are used primarily for emphasis. Demonstratives are used similar to English.

	Verbs are a fundamental part of Wôpanâak, can be inflected in a lot of ways, and make for lovely “word poems” due to polysynthesis and verbal adjectives. Verbal 3rd person markers are in the form of a suffix, rather than a prefix, which can give standalone verbs the appearance being sentential morphemes. Some verbs are only used in inflected forms and their uninflected stems are never seen- does that obligatory inflection mean there are no sentential single morpheme verbs? There are four classes of verbs: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Intransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA), and Transitive Inanimate (TI). Transitive verbs also distinguish between absolute and objective forms. The absolute form is used when the object is clearly present in the phrase and the objective is used as a shortened referential to a previously mentioned subject no longer obvious. TA verbs have four different themes that indicate which person is being acted upon by the subject of the phrase and are accompanied by morphological theme signs.

Verbs have a basic three-part structure of an initial, medial, and final, though many only consist of initials and finals. The medial is often a noun or noun form (which is sometimes similar and sometimes not). There are two kinds of finals, abstract and concrete. Concrete finals give information about the kind of action taken (e.g. -akat ‘be that many’), while abstract finals indicate what type of verb it is. Nitana Hicks (Greendeer), a Wampanoag linguist that attended MIT after Baird, assembled a list of verbal initials, medials, and finals, which will definitely impact the accuracy of any interlinear translations I attempt.

Syntax

	Baird agrees with Goddard and Bragdon’s conclusion that Wôpanâak is a language that uses free word order in sentence construction. Goddard and Bragdon note that while word order of S, V, and O occur in all six possible positions in the native documents, there are patterns that emerge that suggest word order has a discourse function, but it is yet not fully understood. Some characteristic patterns that emerge in sentences are equational sentences, discontinuous continuants, and iconic word order, which reflects the order of things in the world.

Translations

	A real interlinear translation is replaced here with Goddard and Bragdon’s more literal translation of sentences that demonstrate each of the possible orders of S, V, and O.

Language and Culture

	One of the most frustrating things about studying Native Americans in general is they are written about primarily in reference to how they affected European activities on the North American continent. I have tried to avoid doing that and have instead attempted to use only native voices and perspectives, but so much of the information that is available came about only as a result of European contact and the subsequent interactions. Of course, language was a central part of Wampanoag life before contact, the Algonquian families have been shuffling around the Northeast for at least 2000 years, some 1500 years before the first intrusions were felt. The effect of contact is unfortunately of prime importance to this discussion. Not only did huge 16th and 17th century outbreaks of disease leave whole regions depopulated such that survivors needed to congregate with culturally and linguistically related groups. The coastal groups were much more affected by disease than those farther inland, which for some meant it was more advantageous to ally with the Europeans than to be vulnerable to traditional enemies.

	So much has already been said about how and why Wôpanâak became a language of literacy that I want to skip over the hundreds of years of policy and policy changes that resulted in the dormancy of the language. It would be foolish to deny how important these events are, after all, they are responsible in different ways for the language falling into disuse as well as its revival. Instead, I prefer to think about the cultural resurgence that has started with the language reclamation and what that means for Wampanoag people. This is the only instance I know of concerning a language transitioning from over a century of being officially “extinct”, through different periods of reconstruction, and finally arriving at a time when several native speakers are learning Wôpanâak as their first language.

	Besides the film We Still Live Here, the most keenly felt comments about the reclamation come from Wampanoag members who participated in the formal linguistic reconstruction and compilation. Baird (2000) says of her introductory grammar:

Use this tool in any way that assists you and your family to reclaim your language because it is just that, a tool. The language was in the blood and bones of your People since the creation of your People. You have been nurtured from the land to which your People's bodies returned. The language is now in your blood, bones, and your spirit. The language is itself a powerful spirit. It waits in a quiet way for you to return. (6)



Chew, Greendeer, and Keliiaa (2015) reflected in their autoethnographic study that there are big disconnects between the university and the community in terms of heritage languages, and sometimes the colonial legacy of universities is displayed as an unequal power balance between natives and non-natives.  Surprisingly, they reached a consensus and point out, “While our universities have imparted valuable skills that enable us as more effective language learners and teachers, they have done little to connect us to our communities in a way that is real or directly helpful to them” (85). Their study aimed to examine the role of indigenous students learning their heritage language at university, which is wholly appropriate. Of all things, language cannot be a clean and perfect specimen, locked away in the pristine academy for examination. This is true especially for indigenous languages, as their universally low number of speakers is a direct threat to their community and the language is deeply embedded in that- but more because language revitalization is an area that can directly and unequivocally benefit its speakers. Chew, Greendeer, and Keliiaa make clear the importance of community for indigenous students:

Our study makes apparent the need for access to Indigenous language, whether through dedicated courses taught in collaboration with community or flexible degree programs that enable students to study from their communities. Access must be complemented by space which privileges Indigenous knowledge and languages, and allows Indigenous students to develop as scholars and professionals committed to language reclamation work. In this way, our language learning, educational, and professional trajectories can unfold simultaneously, positioning us to as unique contributors to language reclamation work. (87)



Simply put, the academic world must expect and encourage indigenous knowledge to be spread at the academy, as they expect academic knowledge to spread to other communities.

Wôpanâak (Wampanoag): A Brief Look

Introduction

	In small, vibrant communities along the coast of Massachusetts, The Assonet Band of Wampanoag, The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, The Wampanoag Tribe of Aquinnah, and the Herring Pond Band of Wampanoag are stoking the fire of a linguistic and cultural reawakening. The Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project is working to repair some of the deculturation suffered by the Wampanoag and breathe new life back into the expression of Wampanoag identity by, among other things, cultivating the first generation of native Wôpanâak speakers in over 150 years.

Wôpanâak is one of several Algonquian languages in the Algic family (see Table 1) anchored to the Northeast, and the presence of relatively far-ranging, mutually intelligible dialects is one of several reasons the language is included in the genetic sub-group of Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA). Ives Goddard and Kathleen Bragdon (1988) summarize the linguistic area:

[Wôpanâak] is a [formerly] extinct Eastern Algonquian language spoken aboriginally and in the Colonial period in what is now southeastern Massachusetts. The Indians speaking this language are those referred to as the Massachusetts, the Wampanoags (or Pokanokets), and the Nausets, who inhabited the region encompassing the immediate Boston area and the area east of Narragansett Bay, including Cape Cod, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket. (xv)

According to David Costa’s (2007) work on SNEA dialectology, Frank Siebert is credited with first using the term in 1975, with Goddard’s 1978 discussion being the only other published work on the subject. Importantly, Costa (2007:84) argues that in addition to lexical similarities, “There are three main sound laws that are found in all and only the SNEA languages: palatization of PA [Proto-Algonguian] *k; the merger of PEA [Proto-Eastern Algonquian] *hr and *hx; and word final PEA *r → SNEA ŝ”.

The phonological innovations on display in table 2 give some more ideas about regional sound similarity. One of the more important broadly classifying features are the various reflexes of what Costa (2007) describes as PEA *r, and results in the isoglosses of N (Wôpanâak), L, Y, and R dialects seen on figure 1.

Short Grammatical Sketch

A Note on Sources

	The hardest part of any summarizing work is merely deciding what to include and what to exclude. That decision bogged down this project from day one, but worse was the frustration that came from not having enough linguistic knowledge to create a perfect product. The result is that I rely entirely on works by other authors (luckily two are Wampanoag members actively doing reconstruction), especially for examples in Wôpanâak, which are verbatim from Baird (2000), Hicks (2006), Costa (2007), and Goddard and Bragdon (1988). 

Written documentation of Wôpanâak started in the 17th century, first in conversion efforts like printing Wôpanâak Bibles and legal paperwork. A few Europeans delved more deeply into the language and produced dictionaries which, in addition to the Wôpanâak Bible, were important to revitalizing the language. More important, though, are the huge numbers of legal and other official documents written in Wôpanâak by Wampanoag people- the biggest corpus of Native written documents in the world (Makepeace and Baird ). 

Goddard and Bragdon (1988) described the corpus they analyzed of over one hundred native written documents in Native Writings in Massachusett: 

Deeds and other records of land transactions are the type of document best represented, others being records of town meetings and the decisions of special councils, depositions, wills, petitions, letters, notes, arrest warrants, a power-of-attorney, a notice of banns, and a preacher’s marriage record. Also included in the corpus are marginalia and other brief writings in books (principally Bibles) and two gravestones. (xvii)



Goddard and Bragdon produced a comprehensive sketch grammar from their analysis and Baird (2000:4) credits this work with saving the Wampanoag at least an extra decade of revitalization work. Baird’s introductory grammar also credits John Trumbull’s Natick Dictionary (1903) as vital to her work. The current Wôpanâak dictionary of over 11,000 entries is not publicly available, but I ambitiously obtained of a digital copy of Trumbull’s dictionary. Unfortunately, Baird (2000:4) warns it “leaves much to be desired”, and my limited experience with linguistics left me untrusting of working with the orthographic/phonological shifts between it and the revived version, and it was of limited use for this project. 

Typology

	Wôpanâak contains many polysynthetic elements, namely the use of a huge range of stems, affixes, and other morphemes, often creating inflected, densely packed words- especially verbs, which here also serve as adjectives. From their work in Native Writings in Massachusett, Goddard and Bragdon (1988:474) posit “The parts of speech, as defined by distinct patterns of subcategories and inflection are nouns, pronouns (of several types), quantifiers, verbs, and particles”, noting that “particles have no inflection”. 

Phonology

Wôpanâak phonology is particularly tricky to work with due to the sheer amount of individuals involved with the creation of the Native documents and time across which studies have been compiled. There are many different styles, insights, interpretations, and most annoyingly, transcription standards. Even between Baird’s introductory grammar and Goddard and Bragdon’s sketch, the differences quickly became confusing. Here I have copied Baird’s consonant and vowel chart, mostly for simplicity, but also to respect the architects of this revival.

Note: Items that differ from the IPA include IPA symbol in parentheses





The charts contain the IPA symbol in parentheses next to the orthographic symbol. She gives tips on pronounciation: /ty/ is like a palatalized /k/; a lone /e/ can sometimes be preceded by /u/ and create a /j/ sound in particular following consonants. For other ideas on what kind of sound changes are present, Baird made this chart on AI verb stems:

Verbs that…			have…				

End in a long vowel		-m in 1st sg, 2nd sg

End in ô			ô changing to â before w

Begin with a vowel		t inserted after prefix

End in -n			can get -w



Morphology

Nouns in Wôpanâak can function as subjects, objects, and more. Nouns are gendered as either animate (NA) or inanimate (NI). The animate category is not entirely obvious, nor is it marked in the bare form of any word; animacy is marked when the plural form of the word is taken and plural suffixes are added. 



In addition to gender and number (singular and plural, no dual), nouns can also be marked as obviative with the suffix -ah and absentative with the suffixes -ay (sg.) or -uk (pl,). Absentative NAs are deceased while absentative NIs are lost or generally no longer owned. Importantly, the plural, absentative, and obviative cases are mutually exclusive, with only one suffix being attached. Nouns are also able to take a locative suffix, -ut (in, on, at), which doesn’t distinguish number. Both NA and NI nouns contain sets of dependent or inalienable nouns which must show possession with prefixes. See paradigm tables for examples of possessive prefixes. These possessive prefixes are altered thus: for dependent, vowel initial nouns the prefix its ‘u’; nouns that vowel initial but not dependent receive an intrusive ‘t’ between prefix and stem; consonant initial nouns will ise the expected prefix unless it’s initial m, p, k, or w, in which case the third person prefix wu- drops its ‘w’ and becomes u-.

	Pronouns and demonstratives are also gendered via animacy. Pronouns must be used in certain situations, like in nominal sentences where the predicate is a noun instead of a verb, but in verbal sentences are used primarily for emphasis. Demonstratives are used similar to English.

	Verbs are a fundamental part of Wôpanâak, can be inflected in a lot of ways, and make for lovely “word poems” due to polysynthesis and verbal adjectives. Verbal 3rd person markers are in the form of a suffix, rather than a prefix, which can give standalone verbs the appearance being sentential morphemes. Some verbs are only used in inflected forms and their uninflected stems are never seen- does that obligatory inflection mean there are no sentential single morpheme verbs? There are four classes of verbs: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Intransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA), and Transitive Inanimate (TI). Transitive verbs also distinguish between absolute and objective forms. The absolute form is used when the object is clearly present in the phrase and the objective is used as a shortened referential to a previously mentioned subject no longer obvious. TA verbs have four different themes that indicate which person is being acted upon by the subject of the phrase and are accompanied by morphological theme signs.

Verbs have a basic three-part structure of an initial, medial, and final, though many only consist of initials and finals. The medial is often a noun or noun form (which is sometimes similar and sometimes not). There are two kinds of finals, abstract and concrete. Concrete finals give information about the kind of action taken (e.g. -akat ‘be that many’), while abstract finals indicate what type of verb it is. Nitana Hicks (Greendeer), a Wampanoag linguist that attended MIT after Baird, assembled a list of verbal initials, medials, and finals, which will definitely impact the accuracy of any interlinear translations I attempt.

Syntax

	Baird agrees with Goddard and Bragdon’s conclusion that Wôpanâak is a language that uses free word order in sentence construction. Goddard and Bragdon note that while word order of S, V, and O occur in all six possible positions in the native documents, there are patterns that emerge that suggest word order has a discourse function, but it is yet not fully understood. Some characteristic patterns that emerge in sentences are equational sentences, discontinuous continuants, and iconic word order, which reflects the order of things in the world.

Translations

	A real interlinear translation is replaced here with Goddard and Bragdon’s more literal translation of sentences that demonstrate each of the possible orders of S, V, and O.

Language and Culture

	One of the most frustrating things about studying Native Americans in general is they are written about primarily in reference to how they affected European activities on the North American continent. I have tried to avoid doing that and have instead attempted to use only native voices and perspectives, but so much of the information that is available came about only as a result of European contact and the subsequent interactions. Of course, language was a central part of Wampanoag life before contact, the Algonquian families have been shuffling around the Northeast for at least 2000 years, some 1500 years before the first intrusions were felt. The effect of contact is unfortunately of prime importance to this discussion. Not only did huge 16th and 17th century outbreaks of disease leave whole regions depopulated such that survivors needed to congregate with culturally and linguistically related groups. The coastal groups were much more affected by disease than those farther inland, which for some meant it was more advantageous to ally with the Europeans than to be vulnerable to traditional enemies.

	So much has already been said about how and why Wôpanâak became a language of literacy that I want to skip over the hundreds of years of policy and policy changes that resulted in the dormancy of the language. It would be foolish to deny how important these events are, after all, they are responsible in different ways for the language falling into disuse as well as its revival. Instead, I prefer to think about the cultural resurgence that has started with the language reclamation and what that means for Wampanoag people. This is the only instance I know of concerning a language transitioning from over a century of being officially “extinct”, through different periods of reconstruction, and finally arriving at a time when several native speakers are learning Wôpanâak as their first language.

	Besides the film We Still Live Here, the most keenly felt comments about the reclamation come from Wampanoag members who participated in the formal linguistic reconstruction and compilation. Baird (2000) says of her introductory grammar:

Use this tool in any way that assists you and your family to reclaim your language because it is just that, a tool. The language was in the blood and bones of your People since the creation of your People. You have been nurtured from the land to which your People's bodies returned. The language is now in your blood, bones, and your spirit. The language is itself a powerful spirit. It waits in a quiet way for you to return. (6)



Chew, Greendeer, and Keliiaa (2015) reflected in their autoethnographic study that there are big disconnects between the university and the community in terms of heritage languages, and sometimes the colonial legacy of universities is displayed as an unequal power balance between natives and non-natives.  Surprisingly, they reached a consensus and point out, “While our universities have imparted valuable skills that enable us as more effective language learners and teachers, they have done little to connect us to our communities in a way that is real or directly helpful to them” (85). Their study aimed to examine the role of indigenous students learning their heritage language at university, which is wholly appropriate. Of all things, language cannot be a clean and perfect specimen, locked away in the pristine academy for examination. This is true especially for indigenous languages, as their universally low number of speakers is a direct threat to their community and the language is deeply embedded in that- but more because language revitalization is an area that can directly and unequivocally benefit its speakers. Chew, Greendeer, and Keliiaa make clear the importance of community for indigenous students:

Our study makes apparent the need for access to Indigenous language, whether through dedicated courses taught in collaboration with community or flexible degree programs that enable students to study from their communities. Access must be complemented by space which privileges Indigenous knowledge and languages, and allows Indigenous students to develop as scholars and professionals committed to language reclamation work. In this way, our language learning, educational, and professional trajectories can unfold simultaneously, positioning us to as unique contributors to language reclamation work. (87)



Simply put, the academic world must expect and encourage indigenous knowledge to be spread at the academy, as they expect academic knowledge to spread to other communities.

The path that led me to librarianship can be described a lot of ways. Words like “straight” and “obvious” - words it seems most people would actually like to use in describing their path - have never applied to mine. If what I read is true, this is a common theme for professionals in this field. People in this field have complex paths. They see the influences experience and understanding have on each other. Above all, they are curious. I, too, have always been curious. In fact, it’s one of the three things that have always been part of my path to librarianship.

I was very loosely homeschooled for most of elementary and middle school, so loosely that I could quit when something was too hard. I spent most of that time reading everything I could find, which quickly turned into activities like mapping the characters and stories shared in Greek, Roman, and Norse myths to try to work out who wrote it first (8-year-old me’s money was on the Greeks!). In the years after high school, the priority of seriously indulging my curiosity fell to things like work- I worked a lot of crappy jobs in retail and security. In a misguided attempt to get myself moving towards bigger goals, I even joined the military. That not-short-enough experience led me to college and for the first time my curiosity was truly allowed to run free. It’s like something was awakened in me; I am so excited when I have the chance to spend dedicated time thinking about something new. I learned that the beauty of learning how to think more deeply and critically also means everything is interesting if you look at it closely enough! Indiana University’s small classes are exciting in this aspect because there is more opportunity to develop deep relationships built on genuine, collaborative investigation. 

The years I spent working taught me a lot about how I want to live. For example, as a high school tutor I learned that that kind of teaching and for that audience was not the path I wanted to take. It solidified for me what I’ve always known - encouraging and supporting those around me to improve, know, and be honest with themselves can and should be something that informs my work and professional identity. From helping peers in 1st grade write short stories to volunteering as a 3rd grade classroom aide in high school to sharing knowledge with patrons and colleagues in my current work in interpretation and security at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College - the rewards of being invested in the success of those around you are too great to ignore. Superbly talented colleagues at the Fine Arts Center and Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site helped me fall even more in love with our rich regional history and at the same time pointed out huge needs for organizational, archival, and preservation campaigns. My goal is to focus a capstone project or internship on similar places to contribute to the success of likeminded, passionate people and the stories of our human past they steward.

The last constant part of my path to librarianship is actually something I’ve learned recently. I can be terrified of ambiguity (but that part isn’t new). I learned to calm this fear by learning as much as possible, organizing the information so it makes sense to me, and finally storing the information in a way it can be accessible and useful to myself and others. Most often it ends up my pretty darn good (but flawed) memory. To be frank, I am tired of relying on intuition and under-informed imitation when working with information. The ability to be trained in aspects of information systems and IU’s vast array of specializations and interdisciplinary networks means that not only would I be able to truly move to the next professional level, I would get to add my voice and ideas to current trends in the field of LIS, all while retaining the ability to stay engaged with the fields that ultimately led me here- art and anthropology.

It is no mistake my path led to this innovative, wide-reaching field. Whatever specific concentration I decide to pursue, it is clear that this program at the University of Indiana and I are a great match.Personal Statement – Austin Spiller	University of Denver – 1/13/2018

I was very loosely homeschooled for most of elementary and middle school by my mom, a fiber artist, dyer, and quilter. I spent most of that time hanging around my grandparents (her, an abstract-expressionist painter and him, retired Army officer and writer) and reading everything I could find, which quickly turned into activities like mapping the characters and stories shared in Greek, Roman, and Norse myths to try to work out who wrote it first (8-year-old me’s money was on the Greeks!).

The DU art history/museum studies program, with its vast array of specializations and interdisciplinary networks, means that not only would I be able to truly move to the next professional level, I would get to add my voice and ideas to current trends in the field of art, and retain the ability to stay engaged with the fields that ultimately led me here- anthropology and philosophy. It is no mistake my path led to this innovative, wide-reaching field. Whatever specific concentration I decide to pursue, it is clear that this program at DU and I are a great match.Statement of Purpose – Austin Spiller	University of Denver – MLIS 11/30/2017

The path that led me to librarianship can be described a lot of ways. Words like “straight” and “obvious” - words it seems most people would actually like to use in describing their path - have never applied to mine. If what I read is true, this is a common theme for professionals in this field. People in this field have complex paths. They see the influences experience and understanding have on each other. Above all, they are curious. I, too, have always been curious. In fact, it’s one of the three things that have always been part of my path to librarianship.

I was very loosely homeschooled for most of elementary and middle school, so loosely that I could quit when something was too hard. I spent most of that time reading everything I could find, which quickly turned into activities like mapping the characters and stories shared in Greek, Roman, and Norse myths to try to work out who wrote it first (8-year-old me’s money was on the Greeks!). In the years after high school, the priority of seriously indulging my curiosity fell to things like socializing and work- I worked a lot of crappy jobs in retail and security. In a misguided attempt to get myself moving towards bigger goals, I even joined the military. That not-short-enough experience led me to college and for the first time my curiosity was truly allowed to run free. It’s like something was awakened in me; I am so excited when I have the chance to dive into something new. I learned that the beauty of learning how to think more deeply and critically also means everything is interesting if you look at it closely enough! DU’s small classes are exciting in this aspect because there is more opportunity to develop deep relationships built on genuine, collaborative investigation. 

The years I spent working taught me a lot, too. I learned a lot about how I want to live. For example, the tutoring I did at a high school showed me that that kind of teaching and for that audience was not the path I wanted to take. It also solidified for me the idea that something firmly embedded on my path - namely, encouraging and supporting those around me to improve, know, and be honest with themselves - can and should be something that informs my work and professional identity. From helping peers in 1st grade write short stories to volunteering as a 3rd grade classroom aide in high school to sharing knowledge with patrons and colleagues in my current work at an art museum - the rewards of being invested in the success of those around you are too great to ignore. I worked with a fantastic group of people at the Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site in Colorado Springs and while I fell even more in love with our rich regional history, I also saw a huge need for organizational and archival projects. My hope is to focus my capstone project on the Ranch in order to help ensure the longevity of the site and the rare glimpse into our local past that can be found there.

The last constant part of my path to librarianship is actually something I’ve learned recently. I can be terrified of ambiguity (but that part isn’t new). I learned to calm this fear by learning as much as possible, organizing the information so it makes sense to me, and finally storing the information in a way it can be accessible and useful to others. Most often it ends up my pretty darn good (but flawed) memory. To be frank, I am tired of relying on intuition and under-informed imitation when working with information. The solid curriculum and several focus areas that go hand-in-hand with my previous museum work means that I can truly move to the next professional level with the skills gained at DU.

It is no mistake my path led to this innovative field. The ability to be trained in aspects of information organization and cultural heritage management along with key archival and conservation/preservation skills means that not only would I get to add my voice and ideas to current trends in the field of library and information science, I can also stay engaged with the fields that ultimately led me here- art and anthropology. Whatever specific concentration I decide to pursue, it is clear that this program at the University of Denver and I are a great match.Spiller 4

Dear Linda,

	I can only apologize for the quality of this work. Well, apologize and try to explain. Earlier in the semester we spoke regarding some of the reasons I felt I was struggling- unsurprisingly, the transition of graduating brought up some deeply rooted psychological issues that are connected generally to transitions. I’ve been unraveling those issues in psychoanalysis for a few years, which has been great, however it was apparently a cosmic design for me to reach the real meat of them at this time of endings and beginnings. Without sharing too much, the way this semester and this project played out was a recapitulation of an earlier journey that had a very powerful effect on my life.

	This work is clumsy, disjointed, and without argument and conclusion. This semester I found language attractive to the point of distraction, I was very excited about it but had no direction (and failed to ask for one). The result is that I read broadly but not deeply-  during extreme stress one way I cope is to mindlessly buy things (boo, capitalism), in this situation I purchased over 10 books about the Wampanoag, two volumes of the HNAI, and as you can see by the bibliography, downloaded too many articles to be of use in a project of this scale. I assure you there is nothing on that ridiculous bibliography that I didn’t at least skim over the semester, but the end of this paper is me fumbling in the dark for tiny threads of an idea. It is a pre-rough draft. 

You may notice I’ve tried to reword a chunk of works from earlier in the semester. This served two purposes for me: It was a starting place, but more than that I liked the idea of using this previous work about other aspects of Native American worldviews to talk about language. I was trying to demonstrate, for my own benefit really, how related everything is to language. I tried and failed to write a good synthesis, and struggling with that meant the actual thesis never got the attention it deserved. I think I spent the semester blindly confident, but as a defense to feeling out of my depth.

	As always I feel like I have to say this isn’t meant to be a sob story or a way to get a sympathetic good grade- I respect your ability as an educator and thinker and needed to tell you (yet probably again for my own sake) that this is a shameful moment because of that respect. Respect is what allows me to be sincere about this with you. For whatever reason, I couldn’t let it go unsaid, I needed to play it out this way, and I apologize.



	Very sincerely,

	Austin Spiller

The Dreams of Community Language Revitalization

Introduction

One of the founding members of the Aquidneck Indian Council of Rhode Island, Dr. Frank Waabu O’Brien (Moondancer 2005), has been involved in the continuation of traditional and cultural aspects of Eastern Algonquian-speaking peoples for decades. Eloquently, he speaks on language:

A language gives the ability of human beings to do anything within possibility. The capability to Pray, Sing, Name and Speak forms the multidimensional quartrad of all audible and inaudible human communication within and between the natural, preternatural and supernatural realms of Being and Doing. (xv)



This is a powerful, concise summary of the countless domains in which language resides and is felt, and fitting that such a spiritually encompassing definition comes from someone so recently connected to ancestors steeped in oral tradition. This paper is meant to 1) summarize or collect the way I’ve been thinking about language regarding the cultural, social, and identity-forming worlds of some Native Americans, 2) list key examples of language loss impacting diversity of thought and cognition, and 3) discuss core issues of indigenous revitalization of cultural traditions set forth by Fenelon and Hall (2008) as they relate to language ideologies of “successful” language revitalization and reclamation efforts. Specifically, I compare parts of the Wampanoag program to other Native American ones and consider community driven, “consensual decision-making systems” (Fenelon and Hall 2008:1886) as most important to these efforts. In closing, I look to Native graduate students engaged in language reclamation work (Chew, Keliiaa, and Greendeer 2015), for personal accounts of the problems when attempting to connect and navigate academic and Native communities.

The Role of Language in Oral Traditions/as a Vehicle for Generational Knowledge

Many marked or conspicuous Native American activities, like rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements, are all connected in that they work to empower the individual who will then work to empower the community. It is not really a “chicken or egg” question here, all Native communities have been “interrupted” in some way and have had to fight to maintain or reclaim their identities and spirits- these fights are often begun by certain motivated individuals, in language reclamation they are known as “catalysts” (Mifflin 2009:369). In this way, traditional cultural identities are closely intertwined with individual identities; if one’s Native identity doesn’t manifest and/or resonate at an individual level, the power of that identity cannot flow back into the community, and if the cultural presence of the community is so suppressed that it fails to inspire the individual, the same effect seems likely. Persistence of Native traditions and identity resembles a positive feedback loop, while eradication of the same is the inverse- resistance or being disconnected from honoring a Native identity can only increase with time and perceived distance from a group, unless met with a community revitalization movement or is otherwise rekindled.

 Persistence of cultural tradition is the persistence of identity (though identity is expressed in uncountable ways and language is not always first among them or even present), and while not completely necessary for successful language revitalization, if we are to avoid the kind of true cultural annihilation early European invaders designed, all must be understood as vital, unique, and highly contextual. These concepts tend to have inherent power and meaning to Native Americans, but they are otherwise connected by the fundamental idea of sovereignty.

Native self-determination, including the choice (or responsibility) to use and maintain to Native languages as the community decides, is at the heart of this discussion. In her introduction to Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England, anthologist and English professor Siobhan Sebier (2014) reminds her audience that the late stage of settler colonialism is political and economic subjugation “through policies designed to thwart self-governance” (2).  Both the language of federal government and of business in this country are English, which immediately restricts the amount and way in which Native people interact with those worlds. As it stands, nearly all Native groups today have survived lengthy periods of fully external development and are in states of arrested development, though more and more are slowly expanding states of internal development and therefore, sovereignty.

Other ideas of sovereignty, like the ability to prioritize tasks as one sees fit, relate to language and language cultivation. Russel Means (Lakota, in Sacred Spirit) pointed out the imposition of the European concept of time meant (among other things) that the priorities of Native Americans were no longer their own to control. He said, “If there is no time, then you have time for everything”- meaning without time, one is only beholden to oneself. This idea of non-control was bolstered by an Onondaga person (Winds of Change) discussing the fallout of being forced to participate in a cash economy. Their daily lives have been under constant interference from this alien way of living as they, too, are forced to prioritize differently. Some feel like they have to choose between either preparing for traditional ceremonies, which is often the sole domain of use for recovering Native languages, or wage work or other foreign time commitments. As a result, individuals are removed from their Native communities and their support systems in the name of paid work, inadvertently continuing the structure of  internal colonialism while disrupting the strength of the community. Ash, Fermino, and Hale (2001:19) comment, “The pressure to use the dominant language, and even to abandon one’s own local language, is quite generally overwhelming and virtually irresistible … Language shift is often perceived as the only rational choice for the economic well-being of oneself and one’s family”.

	Much of what rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements concern falls into the category of “how to be a [insert group name here]” or like Keith Basso (1990:117) remarks about the Western Apache’s historical tales, “what it means to be an Apache, or, to make the point less dramatically, what it is that being an Apache should normally and properly entail”. These are marked, conspicuous activities, therefore we can say they are inherently different to the default group’s (Euro/Anglo/white) category of activities, and that their existence at all is itself an act of distinction- the individual, the proximal group, and finally the entire community population is each recognized as a separate yet integral part of a whole. Perhaps more importantly, the details of these activities can help highlight what remains important and vital to the cultivators of Native identities. It seems self-evident that the heritage language of a particular people should be the language in which those people are socialized and come to know the world and their neighbors. 

The symbolic embodiments of language, or language in “life size”, can sometimes be a matter of literal survival in addition to cultural survival for some Native American communities. To the Hopi, Kachinas are rain-bringers, mist, the last breaths of their ancestors. Equating breath and life with language appears to be a common cognitive distinction in Native American languages, and while my familiarity with Southwest groups is lacking, I am comfortable making this assertion. I also have limited understanding of the Kachinas, but it is such that part of their responsibilities involves interacting with the crowds at Kachina dances- they are breaths of lives, generating more breaths, causing the people to take into their bodies the shared breath of the community. Kachinas are the voice of peoples- past, present, and future.

During the Pueblo IV period (1300-1540) and the re-aggregation of people at the Eastern and Western Pueblos following the dissolution of Chaco, the Kachinas emerged as what appears to be a response to hostile outsiders and an overall hard climate. It is possible more power was ascribed to them in the Western Pueblos than originally intended, as at the end of the Pueblo IV period the Eastern Pueblos were taking the brunt of Spanish aggression. The Pueblo revolt (1680-1692) drove the Eastern Pueblo Kachinas underground, but survived the conflict in the Western Pueblos where they endured nearly seven hundred years of constant oppression, and today remain a vital part of life for Western Pueblo communities such as Hopi and Zuni. The endurance of Kachinas, their ability to engage in passive, invisible resistance while retaining (and probably growing) their spiritual power, their mechanisms of inter-group solidarity, and the subversion of the enemy all gather new meaning when viewed as the response of a language to threats of personal annihilation on top of cultural destruction. I think for many Native Americans in the Southwest (and elsewhere), that threat never really went away. Kachina dances empower the individual Kachinas as well as the individual audience members, the specific pueblo/village where the dance is held, the entire group that is aware of the ceremony, and at the largest scale all Native Americans who are aware of the ceremony. They are all saying “we are still here and we know how to take care of our people”, and they are speaking Hopi (or Zuni).

The governing or aggregate representative body of a Native group can encourage and facilitate, in different ways (like implementing policy) and to different levels (including not at all), individual participation in traditional activities. However, it seems like a lot of things are out of reach for groups with small populations, even more so for those small groups that remain in a state of geographic dislocation or struggle to keep people in their communities. The issue of factionalism is at play here, but can be understated and is near invisible to those outside the community, who only experience the outcome of Native debate and not the debate itself. Both Natives and non-Natives can talk all day about the significance of cultural or Native identity, but the way those feelings manifest is entirely unique and constantly shifting. Not all Natives desire to return to cultural traditions if they have fallen out of use, even if the traditions are still regularly practiced not every community member will participate with equal amounts of enthusiasm and some may choose not to participate at all. Those that are enticed to return to tradition, however, usually find it to be a source of comfort and a way to be anchored amidst the maelstrom of life.

Shifting from the Southwest to the Lakota Sioux, the differences in community solidarity come into focus. While not without their own horrific stories of contact and outsider violence, Hopi and Zuni Pueblos are examples of cultural enclaves, where the continuation of traditions and languages are integrated into daily life. A residential enclave, or community of Natives living outside traditional homelands or reservations, with minimal participation in cultural activities, is closer to how some Lakota in Sacred Spirit are living. Drum keeper Brian Thunder Hawk mentions moving to the city from the reservation to get away from “reservation problems” and names gangs and drinking big concerns for the Lakota people; Especially powerful is his description of alcoholism as “our worst enemy”. His drum keeper status has retained prestige in the group, even off the reservation, and he uses it and other musical traditions of the tribe like singing in Lakota language to “combat gang violence and anchor the young people”, which fits the idea of individual cultural engagement (catalysts) as means to a larger, centering, group-wide cultural presence, and speaks to the power of social belonging in the face of the pain of addiction.

Diversity of Thought/Cognitive Differences Represented in Language

	In addition to being a primary component of individual and collective identity, language calibrates what and how we think about our reality. Imagine a bee landing on a person’s arm- most people I know would react almost unconsciously with fear or violence; an indigenous person familiar with bees may recognize and honor their role as life-giving pollinators (or honey makers!), and that distinction would be present in the indigenous language. Language is at its base a system of communication, the rules of which are unconsciously internalized and agreed upon by the entire speech community. The inherent differences between languages’ significant categories (of grammar and thought) is the most powerful argument for their preservation and reawakening, and what summons the equivocation of sleeping languages to extinction of biological species. 

Languages are unique both synchronically and diachronically, and the infinite varieties of languaging can be changed by individuals, making language partly a mirror of the unique self. If an identical copy of myself suddenly appeared with all my memories and feelings, we would start differentiating from the moment of the copy’s existence. Small, imperceptible differences in experience and perception eventually leads to greater differences, though we were once exactly the same. Any difference whatsoever is valuable and is something to be cherished, conversely the loss of difference is cause for concern and grief.

The shifting of languages of power on a global scale holds terrifying potential. As will be further examined with the brilliant work Dr. Linda Watts did on Zuni kin terms, the difference between behaviors, thoughts, and feelings of speakers who use a possessive, nominative language like English and speakers of indigenous, more relational languages are not always apparent, but are very powerful.

Keith Basso’s (1990) fantastic work with the Western Apache added depth and clarity to existing linguistic studies. Especially important is his work on semantic dimensions of verb categories, which followed Mary Haas’ ideas on “covert cultural taxonomies” (1967, qtd. in Basso 1990:2), which suggests that there are “taxonomies whose constituent categories are labeled by linguistic units operating at ‘sub-lexemic’ levels” (Basso 1990:2). Through careful componential analysis and eliciting hundreds of responses from speakers, Basso understood there to be thirteen classificatory verb stems that make up seven semantic dimensions, marked by sixteen associated features.

Western Apache verbs differ from other Athapaskan verbs in that they “do not distinguish among categories of events but among categories of objects instead” (Basso 1990:1). They are concerned with the physical properties of objects, i.e. whether or not it can move of its own volition, can be carried by one person, is a long but not rigid object in a rigid container, etc.  To me it seems like the foremost concern is the degree to which an object lends itself to being transported. This is in line with the history of the Western Apache as a highly mobile group, made even more mobile after mastering the horse, and fighting to retain those mobile lifeways well after contact and a sustained U.S. offensive. The Western Apache’s mobility is clearly of chief importance to them and their language reflects this notion. 

In Basso’s Stalking with Stories (1990), he explains the differences between Western Apache categories of speech (yat’i’) and, more importantly here, categories of narrative (nagoldi’é). Each category of narrative has a specific purpose and form, but historical tales (‘agodzaahí) are the only marked category of narrative in the discourse. Basso (1990:117-118) notes they are separated “by an opening and closing line that identifies with a placename where the events in the narrative occurred” (e.g. “It happened at ‘big cottonwood trees stand spreading here and there’”). While covert categories (cryptotypes) often hold a great deal of importance, overt categories (phenotypes) can do the same. In this case, the marked historical tales are a primary means of socialization for the Western Apache. As indirect speech acts, they may serve as non-confrontational means to correcting behavior, but are rooted in the immortal face of the landscape. Basso writes, “Historical tales have the capacity to thrust socially delinquent persons into periods of intense critical self-examination from which (ideally, at least) they emerge chastened, repentant, and determined to ‘live right’” (Basso 1990:126). Because these morality tales are tied to the land rather than an event that demands a reaction, the Apache have more highly personal opportunities of self-reflection, and the story is imprinted on that location until memory or languages fades. The moral pillars of the community are literally mountains.

The work done by Dr. Watts on Zuni social/relation classification is a clear example of huge chasms between indigenous and other ways of knowing and relating to the world. Every previous scholar that commented on Zuni kinship came with a strongly ingrained, nearly unconscious idea that descent-based, possessive kinship was the only kinship and they failed to account for the possibility of difference. Anthropologists like Alfred Kroeber were confused by the non-adherence of Zuni Pueblo to Crow system kin terms, though Kroeber recognized patterns besides blood ties were at work there. Dr. Watts (1997:27) worked out that the “Zuni ‘kin terms’ refer prototypically to role relationships patterned after household-group co-membership, rather than primarily to descent-based genealogical reckoning”. They indicate a social rather than genetic proximity, and are indicative of earned interpersonal or intercommunity responsibilities instead of a “right to relationship” by way of genetic relation. In what other manner would humans live and relate to the world if, as George Tinker (2004:93) says, “relatives” had a wider definition that meant “the four-leggeds, the wingeds, all the living-moving ones, including the trees, rocks and mountains, fish and snakes”, and existence did not equal a right to something but rather signaled a great responsibility of stewardship? This is one of the most glaring examples of some people accepting their reality as the only reality, and exemplary of the deep differences of being that language makes possible.

These vastly different examples of language directly relating to culture and society are indicative of the key role language holds in how we go about being human. Whorf argued for the primacy of language in relation to culture, identity, and memory and as an individual’s basic orientation to the world, their worldview. Grammatical systems are like DNA coding: we use language to constitute the world and the world is constructed through language. Therefore, speakers of each language create their own, deeply personal world. The hope for a planet rich in diversity of thought is somewhat dwarfed by encroaching globalization, but that diversity will always be possible when the languages are maintained. I believe indigenous languages contain keys to a better, living world, and a much needed alternative to more popular ways of thinking. Einstein said “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels”, but it is clear to me that the thinking we need is not new at all.

Community Revitalization

Ash, Fermino, and Hale (2001:20) are quite provocative as they combine their optimism about language maintenance and revitalization with terms reminiscent of combat and say, “There is, in effect, an international movement in which local communities work in defiance of the forces pitted against their embattled languages”. They go on to list five factors relevant to their optimism:

The present condition of the language

Projects initiated; their history, results, and prospects

Resources available to the community

Sociopolitical and economic factors bearing on the effectiveness of the projects

Decisions and agreements which required discussion in the community



The contemporary Wampanoag live on ancestral homelands but were forced away from their language and much of their culture by colonial conversion, resulting in a lengthy time of no native speakers and a language deemed “extinct” by scholars. That was never really the case, not only due to the huge amount of native writings in Wampanoag hiding in musty archives, but also because a “local indian dialect” (We Still Live Here) was still being used- some odd words and phrases had survived in written form or learned from older relatives, but importantly the vitality of Wampanoag language should never be in question. Those Wampanoag words were artifacts of a colonial diglossia (Shaul 2014:3) in the speech community, wherein colonials began to drive a divide between Natives and their language, resulting in the shift of Wampanoag from the variety of Formal (High) to Informal (Low) speech and the eventual near-complete collapse of the diglossia.

Language facilitates other ways of connecting to people like songs and ceremonies, but also ancestral connections, which are of foremost concern to the Wampanoag. With the rediscovery of native-authored texts, language was the key to reforging those connections and getting at what those older generations were about. For the Wampanoag, language revitalization awakens and brings to the forefront not only previously out of reach contemporary cultural aspects and feelings, but also their literal ancestors- they say language is the “only way to see or hear the ancestors” (We Still Live Here). In this case there was a rare physical link to them in the form of the native documents, but that link made beginning full-scale language revival a reality. 

UNESCO’s Ad Hoc Group on Endangered Languages (2003, qtd. in Grenoble and Whaley 2006) lists nine factors in language vitality:

Intergenerational language transmission

Absolute number of speakers

Proportion of speakers within the total population

Trends in existing language domains

Response to new domains and media

Materials for language education and literacy

Governmental and institutional language policies, including official status and use

Community members’ attitudes toward their own language

Amount and quality of documentation



This list, while a helpful starting place, feels like an oppressive or misguided scheme of enumeration desired by speakers of the hegemonic language. In the ideal, the existence of language in any form is an indication of its vitality. I do not think that long sleeping languages, like Wampanoag was, necessarily lose their vitality during periods of disuse or after loss- the memory of an ancestors’ language and perhaps the hole it leaves in ones’ heart are just as important, though not as satisfying or fulfilling as acquiring and using the language itself.	

The frequently asked questions about the Wampanoag Language Immersion Charter School (Wôpanâôt8ây Pâhshaneekamuq) states:

All tribal communities that have successfully maintained or revitalized their languages depend on daily language usage to occur in multiple venues – at home among family members, in schools and other public settings, as well as in the media (including social media online, in film and television, and on the radio). Further, most Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan communities in the U.S. who administer and have sustained language schools for more than a decade all point to the critical importance of making a “place for language—a home for language,” where English language usage is minimal, or not allowed at all.



… because Native language immersion schools explain students’ culture to them with positive, asset-based approaches, utilizing contemporary and historical information about language- and culture-change, students are not forced to adapt to or accept mainstream education systems’ narratives about Native peoples which often frame ancient Tribal cultures as “prehistoric,” “primitive,” “uncivilized,” and lacking in technological innovations. Native language- and culture-based curricula, in contrast, promote positive youth identity formation, and reinforce ancient cultural values and norms in the very languages that have enabled Native societies to survive and overcome great hardships over many thousands of years.



Leanne Hinton (2010:37) describes “some possible ideas about what constitute[s] ‘success’ in language revitalization: (1) preserving the language through documentation, (2) literacy, (3) new speakers, (4) use of the language, and (5) community control of the language”.

Previous documentation of the language is the most important prerequisite to language revitalization if there are no speakers. However, while documentation gives the potential for revitalization, it is not the same thing as revitalization. Many community language activists have argued that a language is not ‘‘saved’’ by being documented. It is ‘‘saved’’ by new speakers and actual use. For various reasons, community members may even dislike and discourage documentation, especially by outside linguists. (Hinton 2010:37)



Like documentation, control is not the same as revitalization. But many aspects of control of the language can help toward language revitalization: that communities can be in charge of their own schools’ language programs; that documentation in community hands can be used for language revitalization; that linguists and other consultants can be hired by the tribe so that their work is defined by the tribe and belongs to the tribe; and documentation done by tribal members can be held in local archives (Hinton 2010:40)



“power over one’s language often involves the development of notions within the community that run counter to the professional interests and stances of linguists, creating areas of increasing tension as time goes on” (Hinton 2010:41).



While economics and economic success outside of Native communities is often tied up with an increasingly proficient grasp of English (especially by governments), Hinton (2010:37) suggests “The individual’s motivation to learn and teach indigenous languages, then, is primarily extraeconomic. It is a counter-movement against the forces of assimilation and is related to people’s desire to maintain or regain their identity, spirituality, cultural knowledge, and autonomy as indigenous peoples”.

According the Mashpee Wampanoag Enrollment Ordinance, a certain degree of community involvement is required for tribal enrollment. This speaks to the power of the community as it relates to the well-being of its people. When considered alongside the Mashpee Wampanoag relative avoidance of geographic dislocation (uninterrupted ties to ancestral homelands) and the fact that The Wampanoag traditional power and governing structure pre-contact was paternally inherited, though consensus based, . In a rare event (though not indicative of Wampanoag being treated well), nascent colonial governing bodies integrated some traditional leaders into their structure. This, combined with the fact that the Wampanoag (Mashpee at least) have avoided geographic dislocation and had an uninterrupted connection to their homeland means they were never fully robbed of their internal locus of control.

Sacred Spirit: The Lakota Sioux, Past and Present

	As a result of missing the class in which this response was assigned, the prompt is a little ambiguous when it asks “how” the Lakota weathered their history. This could mean either a value designation (i.e. with hardship) or the methods they have used to remain a cohesive Peoples. Regardless of ambiguity, the underlying key question is certainly “according to whom?”. Thankfully this documentary provided a space for some of the Lakota to tell their own story, in their own words (both Lakota and English), contextually relevant to their own lives and communities. 

	I think the answers to the questions of what was most and least helpful to Lakota endurance are two sides of the same coin- the freedom and autonomy to create and maintain connections among their own people. This is a necessarily broad statement, but it is meant to include the numerous means by which the Lakota persevere, and includes the external control of those means as being least helpful (but most harmful) to the Lakota ability to thrive. Cherokee Rose hones in on this when she says, “Subjugation has many different faces. There's telling somebody, OK, you can't speak your language. You can't practice your religion. You can't dress that way. Here's what you can be. This is what we will allow you to be” (Sacred Spirit).

	Language, religion, and dress are all intertwined and highly conspicuous throughout the film and they are the common thread that links the Lakota people, regardless of distance to a reservation or station in life. From the vocal activist (Russell Means) to a drum keeper (Brian Thunder Hawk) to the Oglala Lakota College archivist (Julie Lakota) and other lifelong reservation residents (Geraldine Bluebird), it is the ability to BE in the manner they desire and the manner that calls to them that unites them. 

Freedom and autonomy to speak their language, hold ceremonies, make music, make and wear symbolic dress, these are things that provide the Lakota strength and solidarity among themselves. It is intrusions into these freedoms that work against the Lakota, no matter the original intention. Even something highly taken for granted, like Time, creates an artificial and alien constraint that doesn’t necessarily work in favor of the Lakota. Time to the Lakota means being forced to adhere to priorities other than your own. As Russell Means says, “If there is no time, then you have time for everything. You're never in a hurry. That's true freedom. You're never in a hurry” (Sacred Spirit). 

	The Lakota have suffered. They have been forced away from their ancestral homelands. They were made to adopt a way of life not of their choosing. They have retained what to an outsider seems like a huge amount of important traditions, but they have also changed and adapted alongside “contemporary life”. It’s hard to say whether or not the absence of such noticeable traditions would affect her sentiments (or my interpretation of them), but I feel the power of Cherokee Rose when she proclaims, “You may change and alter the face, the outside, the external part of it. But you can never change what's inside of me that makes me this way” (Sacred Spirit).

The Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project

	Language is never static. Even preserved in text, the only aspect of permanence there is the visual or tactile one; the look and feel of the symbols and words as they are recorded. The meaning embedded in language is perhaps most subject to change- as information is exchanged, interpreted, stored, and exchanged again minor differences accumulate over time until an unconscious agreement on a new meaning is reached by the speech community. Of course, in the case of language revitalization, those changes and agreements are undertaken with a great deal of deliberation. In considering undertaking what is arguably the most successful revitalization of a Native American language with no living speakers, The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe ensured the details of those deliberations reached the entire community, and that has made a difference. 

	The history the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project (WLRP) stretches back more than 20 years, coming into being in 1993 after Jessie little doe Baird began dreaming of ancestors speaking Wôpanâak (Project). Here, in bulleted form, is a brief history of the language and its reclamation, including many of the methods, outcomes, and sources of funding. Following that is a short discussion of helpful factors and ideologies of the project.

Important to the Wampanoag and WLRP is the manner in which they share (or not) their story with mainstream society and other Native communities engaged in reclamation or revitalization. This statement from filmmaker Anne Makepeace (We Still Live Here; After the Mayflower) is particularly poignant and points towards overlapping linguistic ideologies:

Early in the fall of 2007, I met with members of the Wampanoag Language Reclamation Program (WLRP) to ask their permission to make a film about their story. Jessie’s [little doe baird] and Linda’s [Coombs] support opened the door to this meeting, but the final decision would be made by consensus of the whole group. This was a huge decision and a very dramatic moment. Up until that time, WLRP had not allowed their language to be used in anything that could be sold, including books, films, curricula etc. The language is sacred, and the Wampanoag feel that it is very important that they learn it before others do. Entrusting an outsider with this story was going to be a big leap. But I had worked with them on the other project for a year [Film: After the Mayflower], developing relationships and trust, and after a many eloquent speeches for and against, they voted unanimously to support and participate in the documentary. (my emphasis; Makepeace Productions 2011)



According to Shaul the above can be summarized as the flux of cultural capital- “As the cultural capital of a language increases and the number of active speakers decreases, the language comes to be a commodity that can be owned or managed as a cultural resource (but by whom?) and may become an object of political debate and struggle” (Hill 2000, qtd. in Shaul 2014:4). Shaul’s platform on Native linguistic ideologies is one that is highly critical of the commoditization of culture, it seems the factionalism that results from it has limiting effects on the success of the program. Again hinting at the underlying ideological motivations, he says:

Language revitalization in minority ethnic groups is motivated by a desire for positive

self-identity, for esthetics, and even for spiritual reasons. This is true of the

cases of Hebrew, Greenlandic, Mohawk, Hawaiian, and Maori. Yet these cases had

large numbers of people who spoke the language (relative to size of population), and

a recognized form of the heritage language as the obvious choice for restoring. In

much smaller communities, the emotional and esthetic reasons for revitalization are

the same, but there is no written tradition, very little funding, and a linguistic ideology

of orality. (Shaul 2014:36)



The WLRP set a goal of fluent use of Wampanoag language in everyday domains, and had to navigate the added dimension of reclamation in a society that has proud ties to both orality and literacy. To Shaul’s chagrin, the Wampanoag have the ability (for better or worse) to do their work in a similar way to the official language model, the drawbacks of which he mentions in the case of the Northern Arapahos: “The language has become an object, a thing removed from meaningful social interaction, following the “natural history” of language loss (decline, concern, documentation, teaching and public awareness, commodification)” (Shaul 2014:37).

One of the most influential ideologies for the Wampanoag is one that symbolizes the connection between spiritual domains and ancestral memories. Shaul notes:

many Native Americans emphasize an important link for them between traditional language and kin. Language is for them an emotional link to kin. Such a belief could only arise from a multilingual situation in which people were aware of different languages and respected all of them. This sort of linguistic ideology is weakly reflected in mainstream culture. (2014:51).

In addition to symbolic ideology, the Wampanoag use ideologies of exclusivity (seen in Makepeace’s statement, keeping as much as they can secret from mainstream society), local inclusivity (the WLRP actively shares its work with other Southeastern New England Algonquian groups if they request it), language as a cultural heritage, and language as an ethnic marker. 

Though not as convincing here, Shaul makes a good case for avoiding the pitfalls the official language model, namely the commodification of the language. The Wampanoag have successfully avoided this process, even participating in the documentary by Makepeace was an opportunity for commodification- it was the consensual nature of the community’s agreement to do things another way. There are certainly other factors influencing the level of success seen in the Wampanoag program, but ideology absolutely foundational in that.

A response largely aimed at the book Lords of Chaos, Coogan (a journalist) accuses Chaos author Michael Moynihan of being concerned “more with fury than with sound”. Offering only a brief section on NBM itself, this piece is a critique of Moynihan and quickly devolves into an examination of Moynihan’s personal life and history with right wing organizations, mostly without evidence. It reads as more back-room or underground political gossip than a commentary on NBM. Despite his obvious problem with Moynihan, Coogan is sure to call attention to the wealth of valuable information contained in Lords of Chaos, valuable only when it has been separated from Moynihan’s agendas.

Originally published in Numen: International Review for the History of Religions, Dyrendal (a 

Norwegian) presents a popular culture and consumption based article on identity and religious identity (re)formation amongst Satanists, which largely overlaps the marginal groups I’m interested in. Dyrendal uses Satanism to show that popular culture may be used as a resource for showing how to perform a marginal identity and how ideological spokespersons use popular culture to construct Satanism by explaining what should be consumed or how to consume. He comments on the individualistic nature of Satanists and explains that fandom inspires some fans into emulating their hero. The article also includes a significant section on NBM itself. Though I’m sure there is a great deal of important nuance in the theoretical terminology Dyrendal uses, at this point I have yet to attempt to fully decipher it. However, it seems some of the more macro theoretical ideas attached to the terminology he uses are strongly reminiscent of previously encountered anthropological thought.

Freeborn, in addition to providing a general timeline for the development of the heavy metal genre of music, also presents a definition of the genre I’m interested in: black metal. His definition includes musical, visual, and ideological characteristics, which makes it all the more useful. He goes on to briefly lay out Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland’s particular histories involving heavy metal (or black metal, in Norway’s case). Freeborn concludes that despite negative press coming out of the violence of early 1990’s Norway, heavy metal and it’s subgenres are growing in popularity and acceptance.

This article suggests the NMB scene incorporates more heathenism than Satanism, and discusses how heathenism provides sets of ideologies, meanings, and practices- functioning as a complex cultural system. Granholm argues this cultural system is largely due to heathenism’s esoteric foundation, and that heathenism elicits attraction. To comprehend that, one must understand the appeal of the exotic in esotericism, and the quest for authenticity and discourse of rebellion in rock music. He adds being an alternative to the mainstream is also appealing in the quest for authenticity. He also argues the discourse of black metal has strong similarities to “Radical Traditionalism”, which seeks a rejection of dominant Western cultural and societal values and norms, and the embrace of more authentic culture and uncorrupted expressions of eternal wisdom.

Harris explores the flows between global and local in an analysis of the Brazilian death metal

band Sepultura. He puts forth a very useful definition of “scene”- a word used almost without fault in music literature. The scene becomes a unit of analysis that is emergent both in everyday reflexivity and from a more systematically theorized, academic space. Harris also looks at the relationship of the extreme metal scene to the wider metal scene, and notes that extreme metal displays a far greater level of decentralization. Using Bourdieu’s habitus and “fields”, Harris describes the context of Sepultura’s decision to leave their home country and cultivated local undergrounds in favor of more money and a global scene- in essence, selling out. Harries ends by arguing the value of his definition of scene, writing that “scenic methodology” recontexualizes musical texts, institutions, and practices within the social spaces in which they are enmeshed.

This is a book that focuses directly on the realm of extreme metal. It contains a diverse range of topics, including an in-depth history and definition of extreme metal and metal, as well as chapters on transgression, subcultural capital, and modernity. Kahn-Harris has devoted much of his career to metal, both as a researcher and as a writer for Terrorizer (a British extreme metal magazine). His work, and this book in particular, is some of the most cited scholarship relating to metal.

Gordon Lynch is Senior Lecturer in Religion and Culture at the University of Birmingham, UK and presents a piece that sheds light on some on the intersections of music and popular culture and religion that are in need of more research. Lynch points out trends that are shaping religion and society in Britain and suggests that they may well have spread further into the western world. The three he mentions are: a decline in institutional religion as evidenced by not only lower attendance rates but also less participation in traditional religious rituals (e.g. baptisms), the rise of “spirituality” as something distinct from “religion” over the last 20 years (~1986), and the growing importance of media for contemporary religion/spirituality in refining religious meanings through which one interprets personal experience and the wider world. He mentions that alternative religions have historically had musical advocates, highlights the importance of globalization and transnational networks in small group identity, and gives a critical summary of what he deems leading research in the field.

Thoughts on Tradition and Identity

Native American traditional ceremonies and later, revitalization movements, work to empower the individual who will then work to empower the group. In this way, traditional cultural identities are closely intertwined with individual identities; If one’s Native identity doesn’t manifest and/or resonate at an individual level, the power of that identity cannot flow back into the group, and if the cultural presence of the group is so suppressed that it fails to inspire the individual, the same effect is likely. Persistence of Native traditions and identity resembles a positive feedback loop, while eradication of the same is the inverse- resistance or ambivalence to honoring a Native identity can only increase with time and perceived distance from a group, unless met with a revitalization movement or otherwise rekindled.

 Persistence of cultural tradition is the persistence of identity, and if we are to avoid the kind of true cultural annihilation early European invaders designed, both must be understood as vital. All these concepts have inherent power and meaning to Native Americans, but they are otherwise connected by the fundamental idea of sovereignty. Native self-determination, the (in)ability to be unto themselves, is at the heart of this discussion. In her introduction to Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England, anthologist and English professor Siobhan Sebier (2014) reminds her audience that the late stage of settler colonialism is political and economic subjugation “through policies designed to thwart self-governance” (2). As it stands, nearly all Native groups today have survived lengthy periods of fully external development and are in states of arrested development, though more and more are slowly regaining states of internal development and therefore, sovereignty.

To try to explain the general feeling for how I am thinking about the idea of sovereignty, I have to mention scenes from two Native films I viewed this semester. Russel Means (Lakota, in Sacred Spirit) started things off when he pointed out the imposition of the European concept of time meant (among other things) that the priorities of Native Americans were no longer their own to control. He said, “If there is no time, then you have time for everything”- meaning without time, one is only beholden to oneself. This idea of non-control was bolstered by an Onondaga person (Winds of Change) discussing the fallout of being forced to participate in a cash economy. Their daily lives have been under constant interference from this alien way of living as they, too, are forced to prioritize differently. Some feel like they have to choose between either preparing for traditional ceremonies, or wage work or other foreign time commitments. As a result, individuals are removed from their Native communities and their support systems in the name of paid work, inadvertently continuing the structure of U.S. (internal) colonialism. 

	Much of what traditional ceremonies and activities concern falls into the category of “how to be a [insert group name here]” or like Keith Basso (1990:117) remarks about the Western Apache’s historical tales, “what it means to be an Apache, or, to make the point less dramatically, what it is that being an Apache should normally and properly entail”. These are marked, conspicuous activities, therefore we can say they are inherently different to the default group’s (Euro/Anglo/white) category of activities, and that their existence at all is itself an act of distinction- the individual, the proximal group, and finally the entire group population is each recognized as a separate yet integral part of a whole. Perhaps more importantly, the details of these activities can help highlight what remains important and vital to the cultivators of Native identities. 

	For example, during the Pueblo IV period (1300-1540) and the re-aggregation of people at the East and West Pueblos following the dissolution of Chaco, the Kachinas emerged as what appears to be a response to drought- of moisture and safety. It is possible more power was ascribed to them in the Western Pueblos than originally intended, as around this time the Eastern Pueblos took the brunt of Spanish aggression. The Pueblo revolt (1680-1692) drove the Kachinas underground, but they weathered that conflict, became a central facet of passive resistance, and survived nearly seven hundred years of constant oppression, where today they remain a vital part of life for several groups in the Southwest. The endurance of Kachinas, their ability to disappear in the eyes of outsiders while retaining (and probably growing) their spiritual power, their mechanisms of inter-group solidarity and subversion of the enemy all gather new meaning when viewed as a response to threat of cultural and personal annihilation. I think for lots of Native Americans in the Southwest (and elsewhere), that threat never truly went away. Kachina dances empower everyone involved- the individual Kachinas as well as the audience members, the specific pueblo/town/village where the dance is held, the entire group that is aware of the ceremony, and at the largest scale all Native Americans who are aware of the ceremony. They are all saying “we are still here and we know how to take care of our people”.

From this (very far) outsider’s view, whatever governing or aggregate representative body of a Native group can encourage and facilitate, to different levels (including not at all), individual participation in traditional activities. However, it seems like a lot of things are denied to groups with small populations, even more so for those small groups that remain in a state of geographic dislocation. Shifting from the Southwest to the Lakota Sioux, the focus seems to shift from empowerment to more of a “putting out fires” attitude, but that is a result of near-destruction rather than some sort of complacence. In Sacred Spirit, drum keeper Brain Thunder Hawk mentions moving to the city from the reservation to get away from “reservation problems”, gangs, and drinking as hugely impactful on the Lakota people. Especially powerful is his description of alcoholism as “our worst enemy”, where the “daily opportunity to become a victim” requires immense willpower that is unreasonable to expect from anyone. He uses his drum keeper status and other musical traditions of the tribe to “combat gang violence and anchor the young people”, which fits the idea of individual cultural engagement as means to a larger, centering, group-wide cultural presence.

	Native voices on Native identities rightly transcend any definition, feature attribution, or systematic analysis imposed on them by non-Native people. This is made clear by the heartfelt words of Lakota Sioux Cherokee Rose on trying to adapt to conflicting use of sacred space, “You may change and alter the face, the outside, the external part of it. But you can never change what’s inside me that makes me this way” (Sacred Spirit).

Responding to: Debra Harry - Biocolonialism | Bioneers (on YouTube)

	In the introduction to Dawnland Voices, An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England, anthologist and English professor Siobhan Senier calls attention to Patrick Wolfe’s idea of invasion as a “structure, not an event” (2, qtd, in Senier 2014:2). Senier describes that structure as progressing “first physically, with war and disease; then culturally and ideologically, with more ‘humane’ attempts to ‘civilize’ indigenous people; and politically and economically, through policies designed to thwart tribal self-governance” (Senier 2014:2). One of the more recent types of policy that suits this structure, whether intentional or not, is that of intellectual property. 

	I am not going to pretend to be an expert on intellectual property, at best I would describe myself as having a passing familiarity with the subject, but Debra Harry argues such policies have far-reaching consequences that affect everyone, though indigenous peoples feel them most keenly. The fact that these policies impact anything at all makes the argument for a closer understanding of them, but as so-called “settler states” (Biocolonialism) and industrialized states more generally impinge upon indigenous lives aiming to extract and control intellectual resources, a sense of urgency starts to develop. In this talk, Harry is able to skip a detailed or even general explanation of intellectual property laws and speak some of the obvious ways new policy will negatively affect indigenous people. 

Harry’s main concern is a new (in 2012, I am unsure of its current status) document that is attempting to add more things that would be covered under the umbrella of ownable intellectual property. In this case, she means the term “traditional cultural expressions” of indigenous groups: Songs, designs, dances, art, maybe even language. Harry laments that if the policy was enacted with the wording she is familiar with, “whatever we do to express who we are is now covered” (Biocolonialism) under intellectual property law. On its own that doesn’t seem like much of a problem, it would be good for an indigenous group to take control of important aspects of their own lives and move towards a greater degree of self-determination- if that were the case. The bigger issue that comes to light is that the rules for setting up the legal rights for indigenous populations is fully up to the state and there is no framework in place to guide that process. Further, often these rules are legally based on previously established rights of the indigenous groups in question, which presents another uphill battle in the fight for sovereignty, recognition, and respect. Especially vulnerable are those already or previously deeply embattled with the state, as well as those with small populations. 

	Harry’s talk left me to imagine what it would look like when a state claims intellectual rights to what is clearly the result of long-term indigenous efforts. I imagine the state claiming the rights to a specific plant species, for example a food staple, genetically and biologically unique to the indigenous area due to centuries of conscious cultivation. The next step, the one that Debra Harry is anxious to avoid, is the state legally declaring that the indigenous cultivators must pay to use that plant in any way, going so far as to only allow seeds to be purchased through vendors and therefore forcing the group (probably further) into a cash economy and definitely out of traditional lifeways in order to survive. The group then must face yet another moment of crisis. The scariest part of this fantasy takes place in the future, because while intellectual property rights eventually expire and become common domain, the head of WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) explicitly stated that “perpetual protection is off the table” (Biocolonialism) for traditional cultural expressions, meaning once a state gains those rights they own them in perpetuity. 

	The structure of invasion continues to this day, seemingly able to repeat its cycle of domination as one method leads to another and the indigenous people are less and less able to defend themselves from “the law”. We must stop this and give indigenous people their due, at the very least. Some form of “common sense” ought to prevail and the ways in which groups identify themselves should only ever belong to them. Stories like this, in which news writer Paula Peters learns the word “wampum” has been trademarked by a non-native, should be the exception, not the rule: “As a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe I was personally perplexed. I asked the trademark office, how could such a thing happen? How could a word and term of our language as common as cottage cheese be given over exclusively to a white woman and denied to us forever?” (2014:481). The trademark owner was hotly right-eous over her ownership, and refused to take responsibility for what is clearly cultural appropriation, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Cooperation is the key, however what that cooperation actually looks like legally and in practice, I still don’t know. I hold hope that it is possible.

Storytelling and Reconciliation

	The time our class got to spend listening to Mohawk storyteller Sabrina Forest, while short, was powerful, illuminating, and raised lots of questions. Or rather, for me, it raised the same question over and over, just with different focal points: “Where are the native voices?”. To be fair, that has been the question ever since a teacher helped to turn my lightbulb on, which happened more recently than I would like to admit. In my world, especially in my world at university, the voice of instruction has been white. More than that, the people who determine what the voice of instruction actually says as well as the standards to which they and their pupils are held are decidedly monocultural; They belong to the culture of (Western?) science.

	I will not be the last to notice the incredible dearth of native perspectives that spans most subjects of global discourse, especially those most associated with self-determination like government and science. As an exiting non-native undergraduate, I am lacking both the depth and breadth of knowledge to comment specifically on the effects of inclusion and diversity practices on science. In addition, it seems likely my perspective of time is skewed rather myopically, but despite that the sense I have is that it has taken far too long for indigenous voices to be heard, particularly by academia. Without her providing much background, I was able to connect Sabrina’s stories to academic realms of cognition, socialization, globalization, phenomenology, sense experience, curriculum development, ecology, materials science, and the list goes on. 

Clearly, science can and does benefit from new voices and perspectives, as they are different tools to use and store in our human workbench as we try to figure out what it means to be human. At first it was hard for me to think about what benefits science brings to indigeneity- all the things that were supposed to be benefits ended up being, in my mind, insufficient redress for wounds inflicted by imposition upon indigenous peoples. Once I situated the ideas in a contemporary context, the image of dimensions of power and solidarity (x and y axis) appeared in my mind. Because the dominant mode of thinking is so rooted in science, conspicuously incorporating indigenous ideas grants them a certain amount of legitimacy and power. 

Wisdom of the Elders makes abundantly clear that indigenous populations are/were perfectly well suited to life in their respective ecological niches and for the most part conscientiously succeeded in living sustainably. There are always exceptions, the several “boom and bust” periods at some Southwest Pueblos attest to this. It’s true that some early fruits of science, like hot metal/ironworking, would have been materially beneficial to Native Americans. Often, however, unforeseen consequences come swiftly to bear, as evidenced by the economic maelstrom the Wampanoag endured after metal drills were introduced, which hugely increased the ability to make shell wampum (not exactly a currency, but is a possession of power). There is no going back to fix things though, which is a fact that is not getting easier to swallow. We must think of the world today, and today science has the power and indigenous groups have the solidarity- but we are all human and can come together for the benefit of all.

	I think, when academia is concerned, ideas like “compromise” and a “middle ground” feel inherently like a loss, that one has to give something up that will be dearly missed. The most powerful idea from Sabrina’s stories for me was about the “River of Reconciliation”. I feel… not quite right about coopting that term, which oozes intentionality and a deep importance. However, the themes of “unity in diversity” and of (re)integration from the story are a reality here as well, and “reconciliation” denotes true mutual benefits, unlike “compromise” which seems to denote true mutual loss. Reconciliation, in terms of the academy, seems to be possible- and necessary. 

The fact that Native Americans want to engage with academia at all must not be taken for granted. Since science is the dominant thinking in this country and it can only benefit by adding voices to its choir, it must strive to integrate those who remain unheard. Nitana Hicks Greendeer, a Wampanoag linguist trained at MIT, the university most closely involved with the revitalization of Wôpanâak language, remembers, “the university was not supportive of her inclusion of Wampanoag knowledge in the academy in the same way it expected her to use her academic knowledge in her community” (Chew, Greendeer, and Keliiaa 2015:85). This seems like a slap in the face, and a good place to start turning things around. The native voices have been here all along, we just have to listen.

Research Statement

Working Title: The Importance of Place in Indigenous Cultural, Linguistic, and Ecological Sustainability

	At this stage of research, I am thinking of attempting to anchor indigenous conceptualizations of “Place” to the practices (whether overt or not) of cultural, linguistic, and ecological sustainability. Of increasing clarity to me is how deeply rooted Place is in regard to the complex, multidimensional idea of indigenous identity. Virtually every group I’ve learned about during my studies sees themselves as being not only from, but of the land, and therefore inextricable from it.

I believe how a people see themselves in relation to the land is a key part of sustaining culture (e.g. Western Apache placenames as means of criticism), language (e.g. 17th century Wampanoag land documents used to revitalize the language), and ecology (e.g. Desana notions of ecological energy systems). As the project progresses it may narrow or widen in scope, but will surely include more examples than those I’ve listed.

	This is a collection of essays in linguistic anthropology from Western Apache scholar Keith Basso. Several aspects of Western Apache linguistics are covered, and though the focus is largely sociolinguistic (or at least semantic), technical descriptions of linguistic features are used to further elucidate the connection between language, people, and place, and to generate basic quantitative data. Of particular concern to me is the chapter titled, ‘Stalking with Stories’: Names, Places, and Moral Narratives among the Western Apache. Here, we learn how important parts of Western Apache culture and social mores are maintained and reinforced by what Basso calls “historical tales” that are about “… historical events and their geographical locations …[and] the system of rules and values according to which Apaches expect each other to organize and regulate their lives” (117). These stories focused on landscapes and placenames provide a way for the non-confrontational Apaches to remind people “how to live right”, with “geographical features…as indispensable mnemonic pegs on which to hang the moral teachings of their history” (128).

This book has become increasingly provocative over the semester and due to its concentration on ecology, will provide several examples in which Place relates to ecological sustainability. It seems ideas about the give and take of resources are similar for many peoples (at least in terms of interconnectedness), so perhaps I will end up with a slightly different focal point than the broad one of “ecology”.

Preliminary Thesis Statement

An analysis of Norwegian Census data reveals a link between the inception and rise of early 1990’s Norwegian Black Metal music and overall Norwegian religious attendance and religious identity. Norwegian Black Metal’s staunch antichristian/antimodernity content, a spate of church burnings and murders, and the resulting media oversaturation all contributed to this link. A small case study of the Norwegian Black Metal band Dimmu Borgir will illustrate the dichotomous history of this music scene. Rising from the extreme, violent, and cult-like beginnings of the scene, to becoming the first ever black metal band with a number one album in their home country in 2007 and a concert/documentary broadcast on state television in 2011, Dimmu Borgir represents nearly the full spectrum of the Norwegian Black Metal experience.Spiller 9

The Dream of Community Language Revitalization

Introduction

One of the founding members of the Aquidneck Indian Council of Rhode Island, Dr. Frank Waabu O’Brien (Moondancer), has been involved in the continuation of traditional and cultural aspects of Eastern Algonquian-speaking peoples for decades. Eloquently, he speaks on language:

A language gives the ability of human beings to do anything within possibility. The capability to Pray, Sing, Name and Speak forms the multidimensional quartrad of all audible and inaudible human communication within and between the natural, preternatural and supernatural realms of Being and Doing. (xv)



This is a powerful, concise summary of the countless domains in which language resides and is felt, and fitting that such a spiritually encompassing definition comes from someone so recently connected to ancestors steeped in oral tradition. This paper begins with an examination of some of the roles language plays in the cultures, societies, and identities of some Native Americans, continues to include key examples of diversity of thought and cognition represented in language, then launches into a description of language revitalization. I argue, using brief examples gathered from peer presentations on revitalization programs and my own investigation of the Wampanoag program, that community is the most important factor in determining the success of Native language revitalization problems. Finally, I look to Native graduate students engaged in language reclamation work, Chew, Keliiaa, and Greendeer (2015), for potential issues connecting the academic and Native communities.

The Role of Language in Oral Traditions/as a Vehicle for Generational Knowledge

Many marked or conspicuous Native American activities, like rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements, are all connected in that they work to empower the individual who will then work to empower the community. It is not really a “chicken or egg” question here, all Native communities have been “interrupted” in some way and have had to fight to maintain or reclaim their identities and spirits- these fights are begun by certain motivated individuals, in language reclamation they are often called “catalysts” (Hinton). In this way, traditional cultural identities are closely intertwined with individual identities; If one’s Native identity doesn’t manifest and/or resonate at an individual level, the power of that identity cannot flow back into the community, and if the cultural presence of the community is so suppressed that it fails to inspire the individual, the same effect seems likely. Persistence of Native traditions and identity resembles a positive feedback loop, while eradication of the same is the inverse- resistance or being disconnected from honoring a Native identity can only increase with time and perceived distance from a group, unless met with a community revitalization movement or is otherwise rekindled.

 Persistence of cultural tradition is the persistence of identity, and while not completely necessary for successful language revitalization, if we are to avoid the kind of true cultural annihilation early European invaders designed, both must be understood as vital, unique, and highly contextual. All these concepts have inherent power and meaning to Native Americans, but they are otherwise connected by the fundamental idea of sovereignty.

Native self-determination, including the choice to use and maintain to Native languages as the community decides, is at the heart of this discussion. In her introduction to Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England, anthologist and English professor Siobhan Sebier (2014) reminds her audience that the late stage of settler colonialism is political and economic subjugation “through policies designed to thwart self-governance” (2).  Both the language of federal government and of business in this country are English, which immediately places restrictions on the amount and way in which Native people interact with those worlds. As it stands, nearly all Native groups today have survived lengthy periods of fully external development and are in states of arrested development, though more and more are slowly expanding states of internal development and therefore, sovereignty.

Other ideas of sovereignty, like the ability to prioritize tasks as one sees fit, still relate to langugae. Russel Means (Lakota, in Sacred Spirit) pointed out the imposition of the European concept of time meant (among other things) that the priorities of Native Americans were no longer their own to control. He said, “If there is no time, then you have time for everything”- meaning without time, one is only beholden to oneself. This idea of non-control was bolstered by an Onondaga person (Winds of Change) discussing the fallout of being forced to participate in a cash economy. Their daily lives have been under constant interference from this alien way of living as they, too, are forced to prioritize differently. Some feel like they have to choose between either preparing for traditional ceremonies, which is often the only domain of use for sleepy Native languages, or wage work or other foreign time commitments. As a result, individuals are removed from their Native communities and their support systems in the name of paid work, inadvertently continuing the structure of U.S. (internal) colonialism and disrupting the continuity of the community. 

	Much of what rites of passage, traditional ceremonies, and revitalization movements concern falls into the category of “how to be a [insert group name here]” or like Keith Basso (1990:117) remarks about the Western Apache’s historical tales, “what it means to be an Apache, or, to make the point less dramatically, what it is that being an Apache should normally and properly entail”. These are marked, conspicuous activities, therefore we can say they are inherently different to the default group’s (Euro/Anglo/white) category of activities, and that their existence at all is itself an act of distinction- the individual, the proximal group, and finally the entire group population is each recognized as a separate yet integral part of a whole. Perhaps more importantly, the details of these activities can help highlight what remains important and vital to the cultivators of Native identities. It seems self-evident that the language of a particular people should be the language in which those people are socialized and come to know the world. 

The symbolic embodiments of language, or language in “life size”, can sometimes be a matter of literal survival in addition to cultural survival for some Native American communities. To the Hopi, Kachinas are rain-bringers, mist, the last breaths of their ancestors. Equating breath and life with language appears to be a common cognitive process/distinction of Native Americans, and while my familiarity with Southwest groups is lacking, I am comfortable making this assertion. I also have a limited view of the Kachinas, but my understanding is such that part of their responsibilities involves interacting with community gatherings- they are breaths of lives, generating more breaths, and causing the people to take into their bodies the shared breath of the community. They are the voice of peoples- past, present, and future.

During the Pueblo IV period (1300-1540) and the re-aggregation of people at the Eastern and Western Pueblos following the dissolution of Chaco, the Kachinas emerged as what appears to be a response to hostile outsiders and an overall hard climate. It is possible more power was ascribed to them in the Western Pueblos than originally intended, as at the end of the Pueblo IV period the Eastern Pueblos were taking the brunt of Spanish aggression. The Pueblo revolt (1680-1692) drove the Eastern Pueblo Kachinas underground, but survived the conflict in the Western Pueblos where they endured nearly seven hundred years of constant oppression, and today remain a vital part of life for Western Pueblo communities such as Hopi and Zuni. The endurance of Kachinas, their ability to engage in passive, invisible resistance while retaining (and probably growing) their spiritual power, their mechanisms of inter-group solidarity and subversion of the enemy all gather new meaning when viewed as a response to threat of personal annihilation on top of cultural destruction. I think for many Native Americans in the Southwest (and elsewhere), that threat never truly went away. Kachina dances empower the individual Kachinas as well as the individual audience members, the specific pueblo/town/village where the dance is held, the entire group that is aware of the ceremony, and at the largest scale all Native Americans who are aware of the ceremony. They are all saying “we are still here and we know how to take care of our people”, and they are speaking Hopi or Zuni.

From this (very far) outsider’s view, whatever governing or aggregate representative body of a Native group can encourage and facilitate, to different levels (including not at all), individual participation in traditional activities. However, it seems like a lot of things are denied to groups with small populations, even more so for those small groups that remain in a state of geographic dislocation. Shifting from the Southwest to the Lakota Sioux, the focus seems to shift from empowerment to more of a “putting out fires” attitude, but that is a result of near-destruction rather than some sort of complacence. In Sacred Spirit, drum keeper Brain Thunder Hawk mentions moving to the city from the reservation to get away from “reservation problems”, gangs, and drinking as having huge impacts on the Lakota people. Especially powerful is his description of alcoholism as “our worst enemy”, where the “daily opportunity to become a victim” requires immense willpower that is unreasonable to expect from anyone. He uses his drum keeper status and other musical traditions of the tribe to “combat gang violence and anchor the young people”, which fits the idea of individual cultural engagement as means to a larger, centering, group-wide cultural presence.

	Native voices on Native identities rightly transcend any definition, feature attribution, or systematic analysis imposed on them by non-Native people. This is made clear by the heartfelt words of Lakota Sioux Cherokee Rose on trying to adapt to conflicting use of sacred space, “You may change and alter the face, the outside, the external part of it. But you can never change what’s inside me that makes me this way” (Sacred Spirit).

Diversity of Thought/Cognitive Differences Represented in Language

Keith Basso’s (1990) fantastic work with the Western Apache added depth and clarity to existing linguistic studies. Especially important is his work on semantic dimensions of verb categories, which followed Mary Haas’ ideas on “covert cultural taxonomies” (1967, qtd. in Basso 1990:2), which suggests that there are “taxonomies whose constituent categories are labeled by linguistic units operating at ‘sub-lexemic’ levels” (Basso 1990:2). Through careful componential analysis Basso realized there are thirteen classificatory verb stems that make up seven semantic dimensions, marked by sixteen associated features.

Western Apache verbs differ from other Athapaskan verbs in that they “do not distinguish among categories of events but among categories of objects instead” (Basso 1990:1). They are concerned with the physical properties of objects, i.e. whether or not it can move of its own volition, can be carried by one person, is a long but not rigid object in a rigid container, etc.  To me it seems like the foremost concern is the degree to which an object lends itself to being transported. This would suit the history of the Western Apache as a highly mobile group, made even more mobile after mastering the horse, and fighting to retain those mobile lifeways well after contact and a sustained U.S. offensive. The Western Apache’s mobility is clearly of chief importance to them and their language reflects this notion. 

The work done by Dr. Watts on Zuni social/relation classification is a clear example of huge chasms between indigenous and other ways of knowing and relating to the world. Every previous scholar that commented on Zuni kinship came with a strongly ingrained, nearly unconscious idea that nascent kinship was the only kinship and they failed to account for the possibility of difference. Dr. Watts realized that the Zuni used the same kinship terms across generations and peripheral relations not to complicate how they identify blood ties but instead to denote the relational role that developed between individuals. They indicate a social rather than genetic proximity, and are indicative of earned interpersonal responsibilities instead of a “right to relationship” by way of genetic relation.

The history of the Southwest is not completely understood, as several groups have had intermittent periods of habitation in, and migration out of, the area. It appears that some groups, displaced by an intense drought around 1275 AD, re-aggregated into different communities, including the historic Pueblos around the Rio Grande at the tail end of the Pueblo III period, and the reorganization extended into the Pueblo IV period. Some groups had been in the area for a long time, so this could be somewhat along the lines of people being attracted to fluorescent groups, which are the groups that are the best adapted to their specific ecological niche. The often demanding environment of the Southwest perhaps greased the wheels for bigger cultural changes, as people needed to modify their behaviors in order to survive. What we see with this coalescing of many different groups in the Southwest is an example of the common model of “unity in diversity” and perhaps an example of Sapir’s language lag- the idea that language changes more slowly than culture. Harsh periods of upheaval in the area meant groups were removed from the most familiar aspects of life, culture, and especially their homeland. In order to maintain the autonomy and separate identities that were represented, many of the groups engaged in varying degrees of language conservatism, steadfastly and consciously maintaining their languages. In this instance, though language and culture are deeply intertwined, language became a primary vehicle for unique identity and constitutes enough of what is culturally important to the people that they kept the language intact while their culture was modified.

In contrast to what happened in the Southwest, the contemporary Wampanoag live on ancestral homelands but were forced away from their language and much of their culture, resulting in a lengthy time of no native speakers and a language deemed “extinct” by scholars. That was never really the case, not only due to the huge amount of native writings in Wampanoag hiding in musty archives, but also because a “local indian dialect” (We Still Live Here) was still being used- some odd words and phrases mixed with English into a sort of pidgin, but importantly the vitality of Wampanoag language should never be in question. 

Language facilitates other ways of connecting to people like songs and ceremonies, but also ancestral connections, which are of foremost concern to the Wampanoag. With the rediscovery of native-authored texts, language was the key to reforging those connections and getting at what those older generations were about. For the Wampanoag, language revitalization awakens and brings to the forefront not only previously out of reach contemporary cultural aspects and feelings, but also their literal ancestors- they say language is the “only way to see or hear the ancestors” (We Still Live Here). In this case there was a rare physical link to them in the form of the native documents, but that link made full-scale language reconstruction a reality. 

In Basso’s Stalking with Stories (1990), he explains the differences between Western Apache categories of speech (yat’i’) and, more importantly here, categories of narrative (nagoldi’é). Each category of narrative has a specific purpose and form, but historical tales (‘agodzaahí) are the only marked category of narrative in the discourse. Basso (1990:117-118) notes they are separated “by an opening and closing line that identifies with a placename where the events in the narrative occurred” (e.g. “It happened at ‘big cottonwood trees stand spreading here and there’”). While covert categories often hold a great deal of importance, overt categories can do the same. In this case, the marked historical tales are a primary means of socialization for the Western Apache. As indirect speech acts, they serve as non-confrontational means to correcting behavior. Basso writes, “Historical tales have the capacity to thrust socially delinquent persons into periods of intense critical self-examination from which (ideally, at least) they emerge chastened, repentant, and determined to ‘live right’” (Basso 1990:126).

These vastly different examples of language directly relating to culture and society are indicative of the key role language holds in how we go about being human. Whorf argued for the primacy of language in relation to culture, identity, and memory and as an individual’s basic orientation to the world, their worldview. Grammatical systems are like DNA coding: we use language to constitute the world and the world is constructed through language. Therefore, speakers of each language create their own, deeply personal world. The hope for a planet rich in diversity of thought is somewhat dwarfed by encroaching globalization, but that diversity will always be possible when the languages are maintained. I believe indigenous languages contain keys to a better, living world, and a much needed alternative to more popular ways of thinking. Einstein said “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels”, but it is clear to me that the thinking we need is not new at all.Austin Spiller

Response to Hopi: Songs of the Fourth World

	When Hopi say of the Kachinas, the rain-bringers, the last breaths of their ancestors, “they are our future, where we are planning to go”, you get a hint of the cyclical way Hopi see and live in the world. On the dry mesas, the Hopi undertake “conscious preservation of every drop of moisture”- moisture is vital to the corn harvest, their central lifeway. More than that, water in any form is literally a Hopi ancestor-spirit, come to bring happy thoughts and help the people prepare for planting. A Hopi’s work and gifts to the rest of the people continue long after their physical body has ceased to move. Faith alone that the Kachinas will bring rain for the corn harvest doesn’t quite cut it for the Hopi, they are committed to a dynamic relationship with the world, understanding that this is the best way to ensure an ample harvest and a good life for the people. 

	Hopi say “planting is really the life of Hopi” and this has many meanings. On the surface, the Hopi have chosen to live in a near-desert environment while relying almost entirely on growing corn with horticultural methods and without irrigation, so obviously planting and the resulting harvest are of paramount importance to Hopi way of life. Beyond this, however, corn is present and symbolically relevant at every phase of a Hopi’s life. They say “farming is an act of faith” and working corn is sacred. Male and female symbols are highlighted by the Hopi digging stick, making a “soft place to put the seed”, and birth is mirrored as the growing corn is treated like a newborn. When a baby is old enough to be named it is given a taste of cornmeal, taking the life of the corn into it and preparing it for a life for and of the corn. Much like the music of grinding corn at time of young courtship, planting corn must also be a musical affair. Piki for wedding feasts and corn tassels on wedding sashes in hopes of rain and growth make corn and the Hopi bride symbolically equivalent- they both carry the potential to make life, and the word for the pots that store corn seeds (which only women preserve) is the same as the word for women who can bear children. In many ways, most importantly in their own words, corn IS the life of Hopi and life IS corn. In Hopi katimwa (my dubious spelling), a stalk of corn, is synonymous with the human body. 

	Grandmother Spider breathed, sang, and thought the world into existence. The animal helpers of the clans of the fourth world (made possible only by Grandmother Spider) showed emerging Hopi that this world was an alright place to live. The land retained its feminine qualities for the Hopi for many reasons, not least of all the pragmatics of women spending the most time working the land, but also because the land and women are literal life-givers. Children are born into their mother’s clan and land is passed along this way as well, mirroring the Hopi creation. 

	Here I have briefly discussed Kachinas, corn, and matrilineal systems in a sort of reverse order of a Hopi life-cycle. They were born of Grandmother Spider and the land, emerging out of the soil like corn, continue the cycle in life by planting and eating corn in that very same land, and continue it even further after death as rain and happiness-bearing Kachinas.

WE STILL LIVE HERE - ÂS NUTAYUNEÂN

Why do the Wampanoag want so badly to revive their “dead” language?

	For many Wampanoag people, language and home are synonymous. However, it wasn’t until Jessie Little Doe’s revitalization quest got underway that this realization was had. They were sort of resigned to the “death” of their language, mostly due to the prevailing (and incorrect) notion that breathing life back into a dead language was impossible. It seems their language was relegated to be another item on the list of things stolen or destroyed by white colonials and the local dialectal words that did survive were those last tenable traces to their original way of life and their ancestors. The language revival, then, could be seen as a way to reclaim their identity and reconnect with their lineage, their ancestral heritage. Several times throughout the film white colonial missionary work is mentioned, and the emphasis there was on conversion efforts. The remaining Wampanoag are well aware of the strategy behind translating the Bible into Wampanoag language, and still feel the pain of their ancestors children being torn away from their families and importantly, their language. There are too many reasons the Wampanoag want their language back to count, but I think one is about knowing the colonials strategy to disrupt their culture by stopping the language from being generationally transmitted- the Wampanoag know how important language is to identity and wish to reclaim what was stolen. They are grounded and connected by their language. If the language is dead, the group feels dead.

What is the relationship between language, culture, society, identity?

	Language is reflective of culture, and culture is reflective of language. On many levels they appear inextricable from one another, entwined and part of the same whole. Language plays a huge role in guiding how a person thinks. As we saw in the film, lots of Wampanoag had some pidgin or remnant words in their lexicon, but that was sort of like having half an identity, or clutching at an identity that you can just barely hold on to as it slips through your fingers. Language allows the Wampanoag to BE. It allows them to be themselves, how they see themselves, how they want to be seen. That works on all these scales- identity is the individual using their Wampanoag language as a way to make personal meaning, society is the group at large speaking Wampanoag in their community (but this gets more complex in places where people do not speak it, as they then have to navigate an English speaking world that may or may not hold their ancestry in any regard), culture are those things that make the Wampanoag, Wampanoag, and that definitely includes their language. Language plays roles in all sorts of areas like cosmology and marital practices. Language, culture, society, and identity are all bound together and the actual used language is the embodiment of them all.

What role did linguists and linguistics have in the revival of the language?

	After Jessie had the visions guiding her to investigate and innervate the Wampanoag language, she was at a bit of a loss. She didn’t know where to start, and when she initially met with Ken Hale she was struck by the irony of having a white man help bring their language home. She reflected, “That bothered me to my core, that the question wouldn’t be ‘do we do it ourselves?’ That we would have to depend on some white person to do this work.” Later, Jessie received a research fellowship at MIT, where she reconnected with Hale and began work. There was a good number of written Wampanoag documents like land deeds, civil records, and letters to white government agents in other areas. These, and the Bible, proved invaluable as it allowed Jessie and Ken to construct a base lexicon. Because someone had traced Wampanoag to an Algonquin language family and linguistic work had been done to trace how sounds have changed over time and across languages, Jessie and Ken were able to start using comparative typological differences to reconstruct Wampanoag words from related languages. It is important to note that without native speakers, or without people who have heard and remember native speakers manner of speech, linguistic study could only have done so much with the language. There are linguistic insights one only gets through practice and use and it is only through rigorous study directly alongside the humans who are in question that real gains are made.Austin Spiller

Sacredness- In the Light of Reverence

	In my view, and in terms of land based spirituality, Native American sacredness is in the form of those places that allow, foster, and strengthen the connections to the creator, the universe, and their responsibility to their homeland and their people. That being said, I confess this to be a difficult topic for me to write about. Despite writing a few lines about what is personally sacred in class, it felt a little forced and, after some reflection, the location I wrote about appears to be a source of earthly comfort instead of a sacred place. I take more than little pride in being empathetic and feeling the gravity of the other’s experience, but the idea of a sacred connection is totally beyond my experience- I am what Vine Deloria (or Russell Means?) so concisely described as “spiritually bankrupt” (Reverence) and I imagine it would be easy to confuse other feelings for sacred, once the hole in one’s heart became apparent. 

	In an Indigenous Sustainability class discussion about the sacred, Dr. Gould mentioned a “three-legged stool” that represents the three-dimensional relationship between land, peoples, and spirit. It seems like this is a subset of characteristics that are nested in the “spirituality” domain of the four-dimensional world, the other domains being mental, physical, and emotional. In a recent talk at UCCS Sabrina Forest, Mohawk storyteller, explained (did she tho?) that each domain must be replenished or nourished in some way. This led to a fumbling, tentative idea that aspects of Creation, while not exactly synonymous with sacred, are deeply related. To say that Creation gives rise to sacredness is oddly self-evident and inherently accurate (it gave rise to everything), but if one follows the connection from sacred to Creation, a single uninterrupted line joins the two. 

	Honoring the sacred involves that which is marked as special or set off by ceremony, and ceremonies attempt the bring back or mirror the moment of creation. Eliade makes the case for sacred time, places, beings, and acts of becoming. Sacred time is marked by a round of ceremonies; sacred places by shrines or notions of homeland; beings by myth or deed; and acts of becoming by personal transition- all are directly linked to Creation. I don’t remember the idea of destruction or evil being present in the Native creation stories or cosmology, just the trickster. To me, this says that Creation is all of it, and more. What we think of as destructive, extreme weather phenomena for example, is actually Creation wielding more power than can be dealt with.

	I think that the strongest voices for preserving sacred spaces are those that are able to bridge the gap between Native and non-Native perspectives. The problem is that, like everything else, the power voice bestows upon someone depends almost directly on their audience. If the ears of the audience are not open, they cannot hear. There is a clear distinction in the film between Natives, non-Natives, and third-party intermediaries who are mostly non-Native. Most of the intermediaries, like the Forest Service officer who negotiated with the Wintu about the ski resort, already have their ears open. The other non-Natives by and large did not, even when they professed to the contrary, as in the case of the Coal Company. I do not know how to help people who hold different truths understand the validity of the other, except to lay the pieces before them and hope they put it together themselves. In a VICE News article summarizing Portugal’s highly successful experience with decriminalizing all drugs (from marijuana to heroin), the head of the government department described a community panel that provides services like psychological care to people that are caught with drugs instead of court or jail time. The official said one of the most important keys to helping people recover from addiction is to “respect their timings” and let the recovery proceed as the individual is ready. What else can we do but respect the timing of others if they are not ready to hear what we have to say?

	I fully agree with Russell Means (Peters? Deloria?) stark conclusion that Native voices (especially regarding land use) are drowned out as a result of the ideas of the “Rights society” exhibited by mainstream America conflicting with the “Responsibility society” present in every Native group before contact and continuing on to different degrees. I have found the rights vs. responsibility argument to be very helpful in considering why certain events unfolded as they did, especially the instance of the Coal Company bulldozing a major Hope shrine. The first time I viewed this film I totally expected the owner of the company, after he made it quite clear that he did his best to imagine what the Hopi were going through, was going to leave the mountaintop as the Hopi desired. Instead he concluded that while it was clearly important to the Hopi, it wasn’t important or even apparent to him, and in the end his legal right to the land outweighed the increasingly desperate wishes of an entire group of humans. 

	The previous wording isn’t meant to set up this debate as a matter of numbers and “whoever has more voices wins”, as that would be counter-productive in a number of ways. It is intended to highlight the madness of such a system- one person, wielding enough financial power, can be granted dominion over land that has been sustained by one community over thousands of years. Enough money makes accommodating the religious and spiritual needs of an ENTIRE PEOPLE a favor, a burden, and suddenly any religious protections are ineffective against arguments of personal property. Earlier this year, British comedian David Mitchell railed against off-shore tax havens, calling them essentially “a tax on conscience”- basically if you have enough money and the right accountant, you get to decide how much tax you pay. The same thinking applies here: the system is such that legal ownership (having a thing; noun based) is more important than any other context, even that of the people who spent millennia caring for the land (relationships; verb based), therefore the fate of the Hopi shrine became one of optional conscience instead of responsibility to a neighbor.

	J. Donald Hughes (qtd. in Suzuki 1990:152) said “Sacred space is a place where human beings find a manifestation of divine power, where they experience a sense of connectedness to the universe. There, in some special way, spirit is present to them [my emphasis]”. And, perhaps more importantly, considering plight of the Hopi, not present to others.
